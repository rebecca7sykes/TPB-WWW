<div style="position:absolute;top:240;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2"> The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:250;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:259;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeed-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:269;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">ed in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:279;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:288;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:298;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valu-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">able bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:327;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;¡ªnot that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:336;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:346;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:355;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:365;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">got to be men. &quot;You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:384;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">as good a right to be free as you have?&quot; These words used to trouble them; they would express for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:403;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">might be free. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:423;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:433;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">upon my heart. Just about this time, I got hold of a book entitled &quot;The Columbian Orator.&quot; Every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:442;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">opportunity I got, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:452;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:490;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master¡ªthings which had the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:500;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:509;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">the slave on the part of the master. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:529;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:539;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">emancipation. These were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:548;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">interest. They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:567;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:577;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The reading of these </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:587;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sus-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:596;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">tain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:606;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:615;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:625;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:635;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:654;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:673;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">than a blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:683;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:692;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:702;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this ever-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:711;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">lasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed </span></nobr></div>
