<div style="position:absolute;top:139;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">At six in the morning I was awaked by a great shock, and a confused noise of the men on </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:168;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">before I could reach the quarter-deck, the ship gave a great stroke upon the ground, and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">sea broke over her. Just after this I could perceive the land, rocky, rugged and uneven, about </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:187;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">two cables' length from us . . . the masts soon went overboard, carrying some men with them </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">. . . notwithstanding a most terrible sea, one of the [lifeboats] was launched, and eight of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">best men jumped into her; but she had scarcely got to the ship's stern when she was hurled </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:216;left:121"><nobr><span class="ft1">to the bottom, and every soul in her perished. The rest of the boats were soon washed to </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:303;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">used by ships at sea to keep track of their position, meaning their longitude and latitude. It was an </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:313;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">intricate system, a craft, and like every other craft involved the mastery of certain tools, in this case </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:322;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">such instruments as compass, hourglass, and quadrant. It was an art as well.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">Latitude, the north-south position, had always been the navigator's faithful guide. Even in ancient </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">times, a Greek or Roman sailor could tell how far north of the equator he was by observing the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">North Star's height above the horizon, or the sun's at noon. This could be done without instruments, </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:380;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">called the astrolabe¡ª&quot;star-measurer&quot;¡ªwas known to the ancients, and used by them to measure </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:390;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">the angular height of the sun or a star above the horizon.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans tended to sail along the coasts and were rarely out of sight of </span></nobr></div>
