<div style="position:absolute;top:521;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">From &quot;Owl and the Moon&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:541;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One night Owl went down to the seashore.  He sat on a large rock and looked out at the waves.  Everything was dark.  </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:550;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Then a small tip of the moon came up over the edge of the sea.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:570;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Owl watched the moon.  It climbed higher and higher into the sky.  Soon the whole, round moon was shining.  Owl sat </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:580;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">on the rock and looked up at the moon for a long time.  &quot;If I am looking at you, moon, then you must be looking back </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">at me.  We must be very good friends.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:609;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The moon did not answer, but Owl said, &quot;I will come back and see you again, moon.  But now I must go home.&quot;  Owl </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:618;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">walked down the path.  He looked up at the sky.  The moon was still there.  It was following him.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:638;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;No, no, moon,&quot; said Owl.  &quot;It is kind of you to light my way.  But you must stay up over the sea where you look so </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:648;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fine.&quot;  Owl walked on a little farther.  He looked at the sky again.  There was the moon coming right along with him.  </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:657;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Dear moon,&quot; said Owl, &quot;you really must not come home with me.  My house is small.  You would not fit through the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:667;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">door.  And I have nothing to give you for supper.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:686;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Owl kept on walking.  The moon sailed after him over the tops of the trees.  &quot;Moon,&quot; said Owl, &quot;I think that you do not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:696;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hear me.&quot;  Owl climbed to the top of a hill.  He shouted as loudly as he could, &quot;Good-bye, moon!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:716;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The moon went behind some clouds.  Owl looked and looked.  The moon was gone.  &quot;It is always a little sad to say </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:725;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">good-bye to a friend,&quot; said Owl.  </span></nobr></div>
