<div style="position:absolute;top:134;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:162;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar¡ªexcept a small hole dug in the ground, called a cy-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">clone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:182;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all direc-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:220;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">tions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:230;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen every-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:240;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">where. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:249;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">house was as dull and gray as everything else. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:269;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:298;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">anything to laugh at. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:336;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:346;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:366;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:404;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:414;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:424;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">washing the dishes. </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">When I went to town yesterday with the furs I found it hard walking in the soft snow. It took me a long time to get </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:520;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">to town, and other men with furs had come in earlier to do their trading. The storekeeper was busy, and I had to wait </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:530;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">until he could look at my furs.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:549;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Then we had to bargain about the price of each one, and then I had to pick out the things I wanted to take in trade. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">So it was nearly sundown before I could start home.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">I tried to hurry, but the walking was hard and I was tired, so I had not gone far before night came. And I was alone in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:598;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the Big Woods without my gun.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:618;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">There were still six miles to walk, and I came along as fast as I could. The night grew darker and darker, and I wished </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:627;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">for my gun, because I knew that some of the bears had come out of their winter dens. I had seen their tracks when I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:637;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">went to town in the morning.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:657;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Bears are hungry and cross at this time of year; you know they have been sleeping in their dens all winter long with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:666;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">nothing to eat, and that makes them thin and angry when they wake up. I did not want to meet one.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:686;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">I hurried along as quick as I could in the dark. By and by the stars gave a little light. It was still black as pitch where </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:695;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the woods were thick, but in the open places I could see, dimly. I could see the snowy road ahead a little way, and I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:705;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">could see the dark woods standing all around me. I was glad when I came into an open place where the stars gave me </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:715;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">this faint light.</span></nobr></div>
