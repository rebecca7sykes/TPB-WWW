<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It was an afternoon in late September. In the pleasant little city of Stillwater, Mr. Popper, the house painter was going </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">home from work.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He was carrying his buckets, his ladders, and his boards so that he had rather a hard time moving along. He was spat-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tered here and there with paint and calcimine, and there were bits of wallpaper clinging to his hair and whiskers, for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he was rather an untidy man. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The children looked up from their play to smile at him as he passed, and the housewives, seeing him, said, &quot;Oh dear, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:247;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">there goes Mr. Popper. I must remember to ask John to have the house painted over in the spring.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">No one knew what went on inside of Mr.Popper's head, and no one guessed that he would one day be the most fa-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mous person in Stillwater.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:296;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He was a dreamer. Even when he was busiest smoothing down the paste on the wallpaper, or painting the outside of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">other people's houses, he would forget what he was doing. Once he had painted three sides of a kitchen green, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:315;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the other side yellow. The housewife, instead of being angry and making him do it over, had liked it so well that she </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:324;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">had made him leave it that way. And all the other housewives, when they saw it, admired it too, so that pretty soon </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">everybody in Stillwater had two-colored kitchens.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:354;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The reason Mr. Popper was so absent-minded was that he was always dreaming about far-away countries. He had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">never been out of Stillwater. Not that he was unhappy. He had a nice little house of his own, a wife whom he loved </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:373;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dearly, and two children, named Janie and Bill. Still, it would have been nice, he often thought, if he could have seen </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">something of the world before he met Mrs. Popper and settled down. He had never hunted tigers in India, or climbed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the peaks of the Himalayas, or dived for pearls in the South Seas. Above all, he had never seen the Poles.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">From &quot;Preface&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One grey morning the first snow began to fall in the Valley of the Moomins. It fell softly and quietly, and in a few hours </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">everything was white.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:489;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Moomintroll stood on his doorstep and watched the valley nestle beneath its winter blanket. &quot;Tonight,&quot; he thought, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;we shall settle down for our long winter's sleep.&quot; (All Moomintrolls go to sleep about November. This is a good idea, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">too if you don't like the cold and the long winter darkness.) Shutting the door behind him, Moomintroll stole in to his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:517;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mother and said:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:537;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;The snow has come!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I know,&quot; said Moominmamma. &quot;I have already made up all your beds with the warmest blankets. You're to sleep in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">little room under the eaves with Sniff.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;But Sniff snores so horribly,&quot; said Moomintroll. &quot;Couldn't I sleep with Snufkin instead?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;As you like, dear,&quot; said Moominmamma. &quot;Sniff can sleep in the room that faces east.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:625;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">So the Moomin family, their friends, and all their acquaintances began solemnly and with great ceremony to prepare </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:635;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">for the long winter. Moominmamma laid the table for them on the verandah but they only had pine-needles for sup-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">per. (It's important to have your tummy full of pine if you intend to sleep all the winter.) When the meal was over, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:654;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and I'm afraid it didn't taste very nice, they all said good-night to each other, rather more cheerfully than usual, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Moominmamma encouraged them to clean their teeth.</span></nobr></div>
