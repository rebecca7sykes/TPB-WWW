<div style="position:absolute;top:500;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Artisans and entertainers came from all over Mexico. There were lots of booths with food and crafts. This is one little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:510;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">section where everybody is ordering and eating tacos.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:529;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I painted a father buying tacos and the rest of the family sitting down at the table. The little girl is the father's favorite </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:588;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">big birthday party for us and invited all kinds of friends, cousins and neighborhood kids.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:607;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">You can't see the pi?ata when you're trying to hit it, because your eyes are covered with a handkerchief. My father </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">is pulling the rope that makes the pi?ata go up and down. He will make sure that everybody has a chance to hit it at </span></nobr></div>
