<div style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;And Mama handed me to you in the yellow blanket and said¡­&quot; He waited for me to finish the story. &quot;And said¡­?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I sighed. &quot;And Mama said. 'Isn't he beautiful, Anna?'&quot;</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Isn't he beautiful, Anna?&quot; her last words to me. I had gone to bed thinking how wretched he looked. And I forgot to </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:415;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I wiped my hands on my apron and went to the window. Outside, the prairie reached out and touched the places </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:424;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">where the sky came down. Though the winter was nearly over, there were patches of snow everywhere. I looked at </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:434;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the long dirt road that crawled across the plains, remembering the morning that Mama had died, cruel and sunny. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:443;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">They had come for her in a wagon and taken her away to be buried. And then the cousins and aunts and uncles had </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:473;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Slowly, one by one, they left. And then the days seemed long and dark like winter days, even though it wasn't winter. </span></nobr></div>
