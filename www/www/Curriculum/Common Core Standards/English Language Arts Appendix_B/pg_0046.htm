<div style="position:absolute;top:540;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go, there lived </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:550;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">a cold aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda. She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:559;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or kernels of nuts, or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:578;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to tear the wings from nightingales. He was six feet four, and forty-six, and even colder than he thought he was. One </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:588;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">eye wore a velvet patch; the other glittered through a monocle, which made half of his body seem closer to you than </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:598;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the other half. He had lost one eye when he was twelve, for he was fond of peering into nests and lairs in search of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:607;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">birds and animals to maul. One afternoon, a mother shrike had mauled him first. His nights were spent in evil dreams, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and his days were given to wicked schemes.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:636;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Wickedly scheming, he would limp and cackle through the cold corridors of the castle, planning new impossible </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:646;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">feats for the suitors of Saralinda to perform. He did not wish to give her hand in marriage, since her hand was the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:656;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">only warm hand in the castle. Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen. They </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:665;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">had all frozen at the same time, on a snowy night, seven years before, and after that it was always ten to five in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:675;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">castle. Travelers and mariners would look up at the gloomy castle on the lonely hill and say, &quot;Time lies frozen there. It's </span></nobr></div>
