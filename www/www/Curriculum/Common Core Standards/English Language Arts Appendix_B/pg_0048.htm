<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">There was a time once when the earth was still very young, a time some call the oldest days. This was long before </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:277;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">there were any people about to dig parts of it up and cut parts of it off. People came along much later, building their </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:286;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">towns and castles (which nearly always fell down after a while) and plaguing each other with quarrels and supper par-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:296;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ties. The creatures who lived on earth in that early time stayed each in his own place and kept it beautiful. There were </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:306;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dwarfs in the mountains, woldwellers in the forests, mermaids in the lakes, and, of course, winds in the air.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:325;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">There was one particular spot on the earth where a ring of mountains enclosed a very dry and dusty place. There </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:335;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">were winds and dwarfs there, but no mermaids because there weren't any lakes, and there were no woldwellers either </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:344;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">because forests couldn't grow in so dry a place.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Then a remarkable thing happened. Up in the mountains one day a dwarf was poking about with a sharp tool, looking </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">for a good spot to begin mining. He poked and poked until he had made a very deep hole in the earth. Then he poked </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">again and clear spring water came spurting up in the hole. He hurried in great excitement to tell the other dwarfs and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they all came running to see the water. They were so pleased that they built over it a fine house of heavy stones and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:402;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they made a special door out of a flat rock and balanced it in its place very carefully on carved hinges. Then one of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:412;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">them made a whistle out of a small stone which blew a certain very high note tuned to just the right warble so that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">when you blew it, the door of the rock house would open, and when you blew it again, the door would shut. They </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:431;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">took turns being in charge of the whistle and they worked hard to keep the spring clean and beautiful.</span></nobr></div>
