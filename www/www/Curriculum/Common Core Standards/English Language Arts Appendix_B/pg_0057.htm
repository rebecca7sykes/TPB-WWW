<div style="position:absolute;top:112;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Then something small and round and black pokes up out of the snow.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">A black nose sniffs the air. Then a smooth white head appears. A mother polar bear heaves herself out of her den.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">A cub scrambles after her.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">When the cub was born four months ago, he was no bigger than a guinea pig. Blind and helpless, he snuggled in his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">mother's fur. He drank her milk and grew, safe from the long Arctic winter.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Outside the den, on some days, it was fifty degrees below zero. From October to February, the sun never rose.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Now it is spring¡ªeven though snow still covers the land. The cub is about the size of a cocker spaniel. He's ready to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:229;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">leave the den. For the first time, he sees bright sunlight and feels the wind ruffle his fur</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:249;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">The cub tumbles and slides down icy hills. His play makes him strong and teaches him to walk and run in snow.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:436;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">From Chapter One: &quot;The Mysterious Mr. Lincoln&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:456;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Abraham Lincoln wasn't the sort of man who could lose himself in a crowd. After all, he stood six feet four inches tall. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:466;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">And to top it off, he wore a high silk hat.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:485;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">His height was mostly in his long bony legs. When he sat in a chair, he seemed no taller than anyone else. I was only </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:495;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">when he stood up that he towered over other men. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">At first glance, most people thought he was homely. Lincoln thought so too, once referring to his &quot;poor, lean, lank </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:524;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">face.&quot; As a young man he was sensitive about his gawky looks, but in time, he learned to laugh at himself. When a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:534;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">rival called him &quot;two-faced&quot; during a political debate, Lincoln replied: &quot;I leave it to my audience. If I had another face, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:543;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">do you think I'd wear this one?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:563;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">According to those who knew him, Lincoln was a man of many faces. In repose, he often seemed sad and gloomy. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:572;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">But when he began to speak, his expression changed. &quot;The dull, listless features dropped like a mask,&quot; said a Chicago </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:582;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">newspaperman. &quot;The eyes began to sparkle, the mouth to smile, the whole countenance was wreathed in animation, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:592;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">so that a stranger would have said, 'Why, this man, so angular and solemn a moment ago, is really handsome.'&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:611;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Lincoln was the most photographed man of his time, but his friends insisted that no photo ever did him justice. It's no </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:621;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">wonder. Back then cameras required long exposures. The person being photographed had to &quot;freeze&quot; as the seconds </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:630;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">ticked by. If he blinked an eye, the picture would be blurred. That's why Lincoln looks so stiff and formal in his photos. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:640;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">We never see him laughing or joking.</span></nobr></div>
