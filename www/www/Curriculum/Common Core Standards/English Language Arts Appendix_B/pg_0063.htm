<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:226;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:313;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">rabbit-hole under the hedge. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagree-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">able-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:448;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:458;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:477;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:487;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as pos-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:496;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">sible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:506;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:516;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in every-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">thing, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:544;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:564;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:583;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">&quot;Why did you come?&quot; she said to the strange woman. &quot;I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:632;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:651;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:671;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:680;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:690;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:700;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5">that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time </span></nobr></div>
