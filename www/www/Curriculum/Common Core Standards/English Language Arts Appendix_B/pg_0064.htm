<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">less quiet. Across the pond a bullfrog spoke a deep note of warning. Tuck climbed in, too, pushing off, and, settling </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the oars into their locks, dipped them into the silty bottom in one strong pull. The rowboat slipped from the bank </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">then, silently, and glided out, tall water grasses whispering away from its sides, releasing it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:362;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Here and there the still surface of the water dimpled, and bright rings spread noiselessly and vanished. &quot;Feeding </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">time,&quot; said Tuck softly. And Winnie, looking down, saw hosts of tiny insects skittering and skating on the surface. </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He dragged on the oars. The rowboat slowed and began to drift gently toward the farthest end of the pond. It was so </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quiet that Winnie almost jumped when the bullfrog spoke again. And then, from the tall pines and birches that ringed </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:603;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">looked at the world. It was all white, quiet, dreaming dreams of heavenly splendor. The stars were large and close. The </span></nobr></div>
