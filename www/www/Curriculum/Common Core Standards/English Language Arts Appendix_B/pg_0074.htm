<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">their illegal money look good. To save money, each team would only carry fifteen or sixteen players. The major league </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">teams each carried about twenty-five. Average salary for each player started at roughly $125 per month back in '34, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and went up to $500-$800 during the forties, though there were some who made much more than that, like Satchel </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Paige and Josh Gibson. The average major league player's salary back then was $7,000 per month. We also got </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">around fifty cents to a dollar per day for food allowance. Back then you could get a decent meal for about twenty-five </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cents to seventy-five cents.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Some of the owners didn't treat their players very well. Didn't pay them enough or on time. That's why we would </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">grass. The falcon dives toward it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Far below, a gray field mouse scurries through the grass. Its dark, beady eyes search constantly for danger. With eyes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">on either side of its head, the mouse can see almost everything around it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Will the mouse see the falcon in time to escape? Or, will the speedy falcon catch the prey it spied from far above? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Without eyes, neither animal has a good chance.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Why? Eyes help many animals make sense of the world around them - and survive. Eyes can guide the falcon to din-</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:518;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Eyes work in the same way for people. Look at this page. You may think you see words and pictures. Believe it or not, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">you don't. All you see is light bouncing off the page. How is this possible? The secret is in the rules of light.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Light Rules</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Light is a form of energy, like heat or sound. It can come from a natural source, like the sun, or artificial sources, like a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lamp or a flashlight.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:596;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Light is the fastest known thing. It travels in waves and in nearly straight lines. In air, it can speed 299,700 kilometers </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">(186,200 miles) per second. It can race from the sun to Earth in just over eight minutes! Light doesn't always travel so </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:615;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fast. For example, water or glass can slow light down, but just a bit.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Light may seem to break all driving speed laws. Yet there are certain rules it always follows. Light reflects, or bounces </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">off objects. It also refracts, or bends. And it can be absorbed, or soaked up, by objects. These rules of light affect </span></nobr></div>
