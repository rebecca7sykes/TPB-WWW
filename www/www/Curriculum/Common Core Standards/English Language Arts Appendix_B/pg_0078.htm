<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fun of him for having to work！the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">inspiration.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently！the very boy, of all boys, whose </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ridicule he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump！proof enough that his heart was light and his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">circumstance！for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">giving the orders and executing them:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!&quot; The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!&quot; His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:257;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!&quot; His right hand, meantime, describing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">stately circles！for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:286;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-lingling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!&quot; The left hand began to describe circles.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:315;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! LIVELY now! Come！out with your spring-line！</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:325;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now！let her go! Done </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!&quot; (trying the gauge-cocks).&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:354;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom went on whitewashing！paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: &quot;Hi-YI! YOU'RE </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">up a stump, ain't you!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:402;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his work. Ben said:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Say！I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd druther WORK！wouldn't you? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:490;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Course you would!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:510;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:529;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;What do you call work?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:549;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Why, ain't THAT work?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:588;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:608;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:627;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The brush continued to move.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:647;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:667;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth！</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:676;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">stepped back to note the effect！added a touch here and there！criticised the effect again！Ben watching every move </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:686;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:705;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
