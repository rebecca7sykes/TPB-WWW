<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;No！no！I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence！right here on the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">street, you know！but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the way it's got to be done.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;No！is that so? Oh come, now！lemme just try. Only just a little！I'd let YOU, if you was me, Tom.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly！well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to it！&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say！I'll give you the core of my apple.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, here！No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard！&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:238;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I'll give you ALL of it!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:258;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:277;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:287;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:296;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:306;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">string to swing it with！and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from be-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:315;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ing a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:325;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:335;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:344;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog-collar！but no dog！the handle of a knife, four </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:354;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:373;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while！plenty of company！and the fence had three coats of whitewash on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it! If he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:403;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:412;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">without knowing it！namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have com-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:431;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">prehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:451;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they would resign.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:499;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:509;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wended toward headquarters to report.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He was woken by music. It beckoned him, lilting and insistent; delicate music, played by delicate instruments that he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">could not identify, with one rippling, bell-like phrase running through it in a gold thread of delight. There was in this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">music so much of the deepest enchantment of all his dreams and imaginings that he woke smiling in pure happiness </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:624;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">at the sound. In the moment of his waking, it began to fade, beckoning as it went, and then as he opened his eyes it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was gone. He had only the memory of that one rippling phrase still echoing in his head, and itself fading so fast that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he sat up abruptly in bed and reached his arm out to the air, as if he could bring it back.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The room was very still, and there was no music, and yet Will knew that it had not been a dream.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:682;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He was in the twins' room still; he could hear Robin's breathing, slow and deep, from the other bed. Cold light glim-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:692;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mered round the edge of the curtains, but no one was stirring anywhere; it was very early. Will pulled on his rumpled </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:701;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">clothes from the day before, and slipped out of the room. He crossed the landing to the central window, and looked </span></nobr></div>
