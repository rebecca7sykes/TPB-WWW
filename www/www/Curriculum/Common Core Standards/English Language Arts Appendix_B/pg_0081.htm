<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Long ago and far away in the Land of the Rising Sun, there lived together a pair of mandarin ducks. Now, the drake </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was a magnificent bird with plumage of colors so rich that the emperor himself would have envied it. But his mate, </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One day while the duck was sitting on her eggs, the drake flew down to a nearby pond to search for food. While he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was there, a hunting party entered the woods. The hunters were led by the lord of the district, a proud and cruel man </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">who believed that everything in the district belonged to him to do with as he chose. The lord was always looking for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">beautiful things to adorn his manor house and garden. And when he saw the drake swimming gracefully on the sur-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">face of the pond, he determined to capture him.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:362;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">what a feast they would be to take home to his mate.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Just as he was bending to pick up an acorn in his scarlet beak, a net fell over him, and the frightened bird was carried </span></nobr></div>
