<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and af-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fection I bear them; but prudence forbids;¡ªnot that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. &quot;You </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that something would occur by which I might be free. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about this time, I got hold of a book entitled &quot;The Columbian Orator.&quot; Every opportunity I got, I used to read this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">book. Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was represented as having run away from his master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master¡ªthings which had the desired though unexpected </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave tongue to interest-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ing thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder. What </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:313;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The reading of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in a strange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would fol-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">low my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:390;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing. It had given me a view of my </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:409;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this ever-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed upon me by every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wake-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:448;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:457;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard noth-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:467;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:477;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">every wind, and moved in every storm.</span></nobr></div>
