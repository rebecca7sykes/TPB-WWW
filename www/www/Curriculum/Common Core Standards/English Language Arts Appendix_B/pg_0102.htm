<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">when a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">shining beauty was left.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">from his kisses, and the god said 'Since you cannot be my bride, you must be my tree! Laurel, with you my hair will </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Voznesensky Avenue (his surname has got lost and all that his shop-front signboard shows is a gentleman with a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lathered cheek and the inscription 'We also let blood') woke up rather early one morning and smelt hot bread. As he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:284;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">sat up in bed he saw his wife, who was a quite respectable lady and a great coffee-drinker, taking some freshly baked </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">rolls out of the oven.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'I don't want any coffee today, Praskovya Osipovna,' said Ivan Yakovlevich. 'I'll make do with some hot rolls and onion </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">instead.' (Here I must explain that Ivan Yakovlevich would really have liked to have had some coffee as well, but knew </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it was quite out of the question to expect both coffee and rolls, since Praskovya Osipovna did not take very kindly to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">these whims of his.) 'Let the old fool have his bread, I don't mind,' she thought. 'That means extra coffee for me!' And </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">she threw a roll on to the table.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Ivan pulled his frock-coat over his nightshirt for decency's sake, sat down at the table, poured out some salt, peeled </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">two onions, took a knife and with a determined expression on his face started cutting one of the rolls.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">When he had sliced the roll in two, he peered into the middle and was amazed to see something white there. Ivan </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">carefully picked at it with his knife, and felt it with his finger. 'Quite thick,' he said to himself. 'What on earth can it be?'</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He poked two fingers in and pulled out¡ªa nose!</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He flopped back in his chair, and began rubbing his eyes and feeling around in the roll again. Yes, it was a nose all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">right, no mistake about that. And, what's more, it seemed a very familiar nose. His face filled with horror. But this hor-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ror was nothing compared with his wife's indignation.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'You beast, whose nose is that you've cut off?' she cried furiously. 'You scoundrel! You drunkard! I'll report it to the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">police myself, I will. You thief! Come to think of it, I've heard three customers say that when they come in for a shave </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">you start pulling their noses about so much it's a wonder they stay on at all!'</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But Ivan felt more dead than alive. He knew that the nose belonged to none other than Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:537;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">whom he shaved on Wednesdays and Sundays.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'Wait a minute, Praskovya! I'll wrap it up in a piece of cloth and dump it in the corner. Let's leave it there for a bit, then </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I'll try and get rid of it.'</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'I don't want to know! Do you think I'm going to let a sawn-off nose lie about in my room ... you fathead! All you can </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">do is strop that blasted razor of yours and let everything else go to pot. Layabout! Night-bird! And you expect me to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cover up for you with the police! You filthy pig! Blockhead! Get that nose out of here, out! Do what you like with it, but </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I don't want that thing hanging around here a minute longer!'</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Ivan Yakovlevich was absolutely stunned. He thought and thought, but just didn't know what to make of it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:654;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'I'm damned if I know what's happened!' he said at last, scratching the back of his ear. 'I can't say for certain if I came </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">home drunk or not last night. All I know is, it's crazy. After all, bread is baked in an oven, and you don't get noses in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:673;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">bakeries. Can't make head or tail of it! ...' </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:692;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Ivan Yakovlevich lapsed into silence. The thought that the police might search the place, find the nose and afterwards </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:702;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">bring a charge against him, very nearly sent him out of his mind. Already he could see that scarlet collar beautifully </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:712;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">embroidered with silver, that sword ... and he began shaking all over. Finally he put on his scruffy old trousers and </span></nobr></div>
