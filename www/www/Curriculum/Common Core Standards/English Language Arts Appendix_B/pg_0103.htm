<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">or else 'accidentally' dropping it and slinking off down a side street. But as luck would have it, he kept bumping into </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">halberd and said: 'Pick that up! Can't you see you dropped something!' And Ivan Yakovlevich had to pick it up and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hide it in his pocket. Despair gripped him, especially as the streets were getting more and more crowded now as the </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">many ways was a man you could respect.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">1888. (1759)</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In the country of Westphalia, in the castle of the most noble Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, lived a youth whom </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Nature had endowed with a most sweet disposition. His face was the true index of his mind. He had a solid judgment </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">joined to the most unaffected simplicity; and hence, I presume, he had his name of Candide. The old servants of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">house suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's sister, by a very good sort of a gentleman of the neigh-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">borhood, whom that young lady refused to marry, because he could produce no more than threescore and eleven </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quarterings in his arms; the rest of the genealogical tree belonging to the family having been lost through the injuries </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of time. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had not only a gate, but even windows, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and his great hall was hung with tapestry. He used to hunt with his mastiffs and spaniels instead of greyhounds; his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">groom served him for huntsman; and the parson of the parish officiated as his grand almoner. He was called &quot;My </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:362;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lord&quot; by all his people, and he never told a story but everyone laughed at it. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">My Lady Baroness, who weighed three hundred and fifty pounds, consequently was a person of no small consider-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ation; and then she did the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded universal respect. Her daughter was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about seventeen years of age, fresh-colored, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be a youth </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in every respect worthy of the father he sprung from. Pangloss, the preceptor, was the oracle of the family, and little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Candide listened to his instructions with all the simplicity natural to his age and disposition. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Master Pangloss taught the metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology. He could prove to admiration that there is no </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">effect without a cause; and, that in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most magnificent of all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">castles, and My Lady the best of all possible baronesses. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:478;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;It is demonstrable,&quot; said he, &quot;that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:517;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:526;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Candide listened attentively and believed implicitly, for he thought Miss Cunegund excessively handsome, though he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">never had the courage to tell her so. He concluded that next to the happiness of being Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the next was that of being Miss Cunegund, the next that of seeing her every day, and the last that of hearing the doc-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">trine of Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One day when Miss Cunegund went to take a walk in a little neighboring wood which was called a park, she saw, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:604;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">through the bushes, the sage Doctor Pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mother's chamber-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">maid, a little brown wench, very pretty, and very tractable. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">As Miss Cunegund had a great disposition for the sciences, she observed with the utmost attention the experiments </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which were repeated before her eyes; she perfectly well understood the force of the doctor's reasoning upon causes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:652;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and effects. She retired greatly flurried, quite pensive and filled with the desire of knowledge, imagining that she </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:662;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">might be a sufficing reason for young Candide, and he for her. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:682;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In her way back she happened to meet the young man; she blushed, he blushed also; she wished him a good morning </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:691;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in a flattering tone, he returned the salute, without knowing what he said. The next day, as they were rising from din-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:701;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ner, Cunegund and Candide slipped behind the screen. The miss dropped her handkerchief, the young man picked it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:710;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">up. She innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a grace-all very </span></nobr></div>
