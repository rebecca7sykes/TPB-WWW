<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">a dusty coat and checked trousers, who came out without his hat on to the low steps of the posting station at S ?. He </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Not in sight?&quot; repeated his master. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;No, sir,&quot; responded the man a second time. </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:325;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">His name was Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov. He had twelve miles from the posting station, a fine property of two </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hundred souls, or, as he expressed it--since he had arranged the division of his land with the peasants, and started a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:344;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">?farm?--of nearly five thousand acres. His father, a general in the army, who served in 1812, a coarse, half-educated, </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:411;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fice. She wore gorgeous caps and rustling silk dresses; in church she was the first to advance to the cross; she talked </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:421;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">a great deal in a loud voice, let her children kiss her hand in the morning, and gave them her blessing at night--in fact, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">she got everything out of life she could. Nikolai Petrovitch, as a general's son--though so far from being distinguished </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tained a slight limp to the end of his day. His father gave him up as a bad job, and let him go into the civil service. He </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">took him to Petersburg directly he was eighteen, and placed him in the university. His brother happened about the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:478;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">same time to be made an officer in the Guards. The young men started living together in one set of rooms, under the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">remote supervision of a cousin on their mother's side, Ilya Kolyazin, an official of high rank. Their father returned to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his division and his wife, and only rarely sent his sons large sheets of grey paper, scrawled over in a bold clerkly hand. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">At the bottom of these sheets stood in letters, enclosed carefully in scroll-work, the words, &quot;Piotr Kirsanov, General-</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of the lord of the flat.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:604;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">For there lay The Combs¡ªthe set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:613;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims¡ªjust the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:652;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: &quot;My </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:662;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hair grows so fast, Jim!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:681;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, &quot;Oh, oh!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:701;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:711;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</span></nobr></div>
