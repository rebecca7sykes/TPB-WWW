<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">strous vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;What's happened to me?&quot; he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:324;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">metal window ledge--completely depressed him. &quot;How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">all this nonsense,&quot; he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and in his present state could not get into that position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mae said, &quot;This ain't a grocery store. We got bread to make san'widges.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I know, ma'am.&quot; His humility was insistent. &quot;We need bread and there ain't nothin' for quite a piece, they say.&quot;</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;We'd sure admire to do that, ma'am. But we can't. We got to make a dime do all of us.&quot; And he said embarrassedly, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:596;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;We ain't got but a little.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:615;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mae said, &quot;You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.&quot;</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:655;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;We'll run out 'fore the bread truck comes.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Run out then, goddamn it,&quot; said Al. He looked sullenly down at the potato salad he was mixing.</span></nobr></div>
