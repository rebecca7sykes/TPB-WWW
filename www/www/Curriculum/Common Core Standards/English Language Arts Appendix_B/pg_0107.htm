<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame rested on solid personal achieve-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ments. As a young man of eighteen he had brought honor to his village by throwing Amalinze the Cat. Amalinze was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the great wrestler who for seven years was unbeaten, from Umuofia to Mbaino. He was called the Cat because his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">back would never touch the earth. It was this man that Okonkwo threw in a fight which the old men agreed was one </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of the fiercest since the founder of their town engaged a spirit of the wild for seven days and seven nights. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The drums beat and the flutes sang and the spectators held their breath. Amalinze was a wily craftsman, but Okonk-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:324;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wo was as slippery as a fish in water. Every nerve and every muscle stood out on their arms, on their backs and their </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">thighs, and one almost heard them stretching to breaking point. In the end Okonkwo threw the Cat. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">That was many years ago, twenty years or more, and during this time Okonkwo's fame had grown like a bush-fire in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the harmattan. He was tall and huge, and his bushy eyebrows and wide nose gave him a very severe look. He breathed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">heavily, and it was said that, when he slept, his wives and children in their houses could hear him breathe. When he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">walked, his heels hardly touched the ground and he seemed to walk on springs, as if he was going to pounce on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">somebody. And he did pounce on people quite often. He had a slight stammer and whenever he was angry and could </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">not get his words out quickly enough, he would use his fists. He had no patience with unsuccessful men. He had had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:411;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">no patience with his father. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Unoka, for that was his father's name, had died ten years ago. In his day he was lazy and improvident and was quite </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">incapable of thinking about tomorrow. If any money came his way, and it seldom did, he immediately bought gourds </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of palm-wine, called round his neighbors and made merry. He always said that whenever he saw a dead man's mouth </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he saw the folly of not eating what one had in one's lifetime. Unoka was, of course, a debtor, and he owed every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">neighbor some money, from a few cowries to quite substantial amounts. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He was tall but very thin and had a slight stoop. He wore a haggard and mournful look except when he was drinking </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">or playing on his flute. He was very good on his flute, and his happiest moments were the two or three moons after </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the harvest when the village musicians brought down their instruments, hung above the fireplace. Unoka would play </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:517;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">with them, his face beaming with blessedness and peace. Sometimes another village would ask Unoka's band and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">their dancing egwugwu to come and stay with them and teach them their tunes. They would go to such hosts for as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">long as three or four markets, making music and feasting. Unoka loved the good fare and the good fellowship, and he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">loved this season of the year, when the rains had stopped and the sun rose every morning with dazzling beauty. And </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it was not too hot either, because the cold and dry harmattan wind was blowing down from the north. Some years the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">harmattan was very severe and a dense haze hung on the atmosphere. Old men and children would then sit round log </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fires, warming their bodies. Unoka loved it all, and he loved the first kites that returned with the dry season, and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">children who sang songs of welcome to them. He would remember his own childhood, how he had often wandered </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">around looking for a kite sailing leisurely against the blue sky. As soon as he found one he would sing with his whole </span></nobr></div>
