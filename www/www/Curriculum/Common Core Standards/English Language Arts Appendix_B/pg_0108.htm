<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lessons?</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I have been thinking, I must confess, of setting some brief thoughts to paper,&quot; Fremantle announced gravely. &quot;Some </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">brief remarks of my own, appended to an account of this battle, and perhaps others this army has fought. Some notes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as to tactics.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Tactics?</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;General Lee's various stratagems will be most instructive, most illuminating. I wonder, sir, if I might enlist your aid in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">this, ah, endeavor. As one most closely concerned? That is, to be brief, may I come to you when in need?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Sure,&quot; Longstreet said. Tactics? He chuckled. The tactics were simple: find the enemy, fight him. He shook his head, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:344;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">snorting. Fremantle spoke softly, in tones of awe.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;One would not think of General Lee, now that one has met him, now that one has looked him, so to speak, in the eye, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:373;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as it were, one would not think him, you know, to be such a devious man.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Devious?&quot; Longstreet swung to stare at him, aghast.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:412;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Oh my word,&quot; Fremantle went on devoutly, &quot;but he's a tricky one. The Old Gray Fox, as they say. Charming phrase. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">American to the hilt.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Devious?&quot; Longstreet stopped dead in the road. &quot;Devious.&quot; He laughed aloud. Fremantle stared an owlish stare.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Why, Colonel, bless your soul, there ain't a devious bone in Robert Lee's body, don't you know that?&quot;</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:519;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">My mother believed you could be anything you wanted to be in America. You could open a restaurant. You could work </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:587;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">America was where all my mother's hopes lay. She had come here in 1949 after losing everything in China: her mother </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:606;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">regret. There were so many ways for things to get better.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:625;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">We didn't immediately pick the right kind of prodigy. At first my mother thought I could be a Chinese Shirley Temple. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:635;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">We'd watch Shirley's old movies on TV as though they were training films. My mother would poke my arm and say, </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Ni kan,&quot; said my mother as Shirley's eyes flooded with tears. &quot;You already know how. Don't need talent for crying!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
