<div style="position:absolute;top:241;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:260;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:269;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:279;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:298;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence, I should consider </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:308;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the majesty of heaven, which I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">revere above all earthly kings.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:337;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:347;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:356;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:366;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:395;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:405;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:414;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:424;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and the House? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:433;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:443;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">our petition comports with these war-like preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:453;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:462;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:472;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask, gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its pur-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">pose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:491;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:501;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">are meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:510;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:520;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:529;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:539;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:549;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have im-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">plored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:577;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:587;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:597;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free, if we mean to preserve </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:606;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending, if we mean not basely to abandon </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:616;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:625;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:635;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us!</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:655;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:664;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of ef-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:683;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">fectual resistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:693;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:703;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">hath placed in our power. Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:712;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our </span></nobr></div>
