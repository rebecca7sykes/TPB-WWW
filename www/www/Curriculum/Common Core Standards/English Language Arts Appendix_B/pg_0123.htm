<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instru-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ment of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to sur-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:284;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">render their interests. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissi-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people under </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">an efficient government. the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:478;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:497;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">be unwise to extend them. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Lincoln, Abraham. &quot;Gettysburg Address.&quot; (1863)</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:603;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">resting-place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:613;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">should do this.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But in a large sense we cannot dedicate,¡ªwe cannot consecrate,¡ªwe cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:652;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:661;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is, rather for us to be here </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:671;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:681;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:690;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that Government of the people, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:700;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</span></nobr></div>
