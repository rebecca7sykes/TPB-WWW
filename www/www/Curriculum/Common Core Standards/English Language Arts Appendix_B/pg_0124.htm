<div style="position:absolute;top:112;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tion in regard to it is ventured.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted alto-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">gether to saving the Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war¡ªseeking to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:247;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:257;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was some-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">how the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:324;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">His own purposes. &quot;Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">that man by whom the offense cometh.&quot; If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:362;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous alto-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">gether.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for </span></nobr></div>
