<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">We have gathered here to affirm a faith, a faith in a common purpose, a common conviction, a common devotion. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:403;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Some of us have chosen America as the land of our adoption; the rest have come from those who did the same. For </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:413;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">this reason we have some right to consider ourselves a picked group, a group of those who had the courage to break </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">from the past and brave the dangers and the loneliness of a strange land. What was the object that nerved us, or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:432;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">those who went before us, to this choice? We sought liberty; freedom from oppression, freedom from want, freedom </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:442;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to be ourselves. This we then sought; this we now believe that we are by way of winning. What do we mean when </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:451;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">we say that first of all we seek liberty? I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitu-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tions, upon laws and upon courts. These are false hopes; believe me, these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. While it lies there </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:480;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it. And what is this liberty which must lie in the hearts of men and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:490;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will; it is not freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of liberty, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:499;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">leads straight to its overthrow. A society in which men recognize no check upon their freedom soon becomes a soci-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:509;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ety where freedom is the possession of only a savage few; as we have learned to our sorrow. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:528;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">What then is the spirit of liberty? I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:538;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the mind of other men </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:548;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:567;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned but never quite forgotten; that there may be </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:596;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and courage of Americans create it; yet in the spirit of that America which lies hidden in some form in the aspirations </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of us all; in the spirit of that America for which our young men are at this moment fighting and dying; in that spirit of </span></nobr></div>
