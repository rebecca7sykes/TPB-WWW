<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative body in the world. But </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:539;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">would have set in.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the nationwide distrust and strong suspicion that there may be something to the unproved, sensational accusations.</span></nobr></div>
