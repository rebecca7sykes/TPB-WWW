<div style="position:absolute;top:82;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">enough to brave the unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:130;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">several times. And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">American people choose a new President, and 1988 is one of those years. At one point there were 13 major candidates </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections. Go to any American town, to take just an example, and you'll see </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">society and what can be done to correct them. Turn on the television, and you'll see the legislature conducting the </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But freedom is more even than this. Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and seek solutions. It is the right to put forth an idea, scoffed at by the experts, and watch it catch fire among the </span></nobr></div>
