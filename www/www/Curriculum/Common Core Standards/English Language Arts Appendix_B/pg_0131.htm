<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In one of his letters to a young painter, C¨¦zanne had advised him to look at nature in terms of spheres, cones and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cylinders. He presumably meant that he should always keep these basic solid shapes in mind when organizing his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">pictures. But Picasso and his friends decided to take this advice literally. I suppose that they reasoned somewhat like </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">this: 'We have long given up claiming that we represent things as they appear to our eyes. That was a will-o'-the-wisp </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which it is useless to pursue. We do not want to fix on the canvas the imaginary impression of a fleeting moment. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Let us follow C¨¦zanne's example, and build up the picture of our motifs as solidly and enduringly as we can. Why not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">be consistent and accept the fact that our real aim is rather to construct something, rather than to copy something? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:226;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">If we think of an object, let us say a violin, it does not appear before the eye of our mind the way it would appear </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">before our bodily eyes. We can, and in fact do, think of its various aspects at the same time. Some of them stand out </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">so clearly that we feel we can touch them and handle them; others are somehow blurred. And this strange medley of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">images represents more of the &quot;real&quot; violin than any single snapshot or meticulous painting could ever contain.' This, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I suppose, was the reasoning which led to such paintings as Picasso's still life of a violin, figure 374. In some respects, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:274;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it represents a return to what we have called Egyptian principles, in which an object was drawn from the angle from </span></nobr></div>
