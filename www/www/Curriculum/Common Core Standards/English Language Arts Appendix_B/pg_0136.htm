<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tional dynamics and energy conversion. I have been exploring the rides at Geauga Lake Amusement Park near Cleve-</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">To me the scariest rides at the park are the roller coasters. The Big Dipper is similar to many of the roller coasters that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:411;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">have thrilled passengers for most of this century. The cars are pulled by chain t the top of the highest hill along the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">track, Released from the chain as the front of the car begins its descent, the unpowered cars have almost no speed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and only a small acceleration. As more cars get onto the downward slope the acceleration increases. It peaks when all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the cars are headed downward. The peak value is the product of the acceleration generated by gravity and the sine of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the slope of the track. A steeper descent generates a greater acceleration, but packing the coaster with heavier pas-</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">symmetrically distributed in the valley. The acceleration is zero. As more cars ascend the coaster begins to slow, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:497;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">reaching its lowest speed just as it is symmetrically positioned at the top of the hill.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:517;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A roller coaster functions by means of transfers of energy. When the chain hauls the cars to the top of the first hill, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it does work on the cars, endowing them with gravitational potential energy, the energy of a body in a gravitational </span></nobr></div>
