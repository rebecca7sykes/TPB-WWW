<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tronomy, time keeping, surveying, navigation, and astrology. The principles behind the most common variety, the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:545;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">planispheric astrolabe, were first laid down in antiquity by the Greeks, who pioneered the notion of projecting three-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dimensional images on flat surfaces. The device reached a high degree of refinement in the medieval Islamic world, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:564;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">where it was invaluable for determining prayer times and the direction of Mecca from anywhere in the Muslim world. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The astrolabe was introduced to Europe by the eleventh century, where is saw wide use until the Renaissance.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The fundamental innovation underlying the astrolabe was the projection of an image of the sky (usually the northern </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:603;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hemisphere, centered on Polaris) on a plane corresponding to the earth's equator. This image, which was typically </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">etched on a brass plate, was inserted into a round frame (the mater) whose circumference was marked in degrees </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">or hours. Over the plate was fitted a lattice-work disk, the rete, with pointers to indicate the positions of major stars. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A metal hand, similar to those on a clock, was hinged with the rete at the center of the instrument, as was a sighting </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:651;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">device was usually not more than six to eight inches in diameter and half an inch thick.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:670;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One common use of the astrolabe was to determine the time of day, even after dark.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:690;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Other uses included determination of sunrise, and sunset times for any date past or future, predicting eclipses, finding </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:699;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">important stars or constellations, and measuring the height of earthbound objects and the circumference of the earth. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">For this and other reasons, the astrolabe has been called &quot;the world's first personal computer.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
