<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixa-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">da or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">round) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composi-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tion, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like &quot;the reason of the unreason with which my </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;&quot; or again, &quot;the high heavens, that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves.&quot; Over </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come to life again for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">seams and scars. He commended, however, the author's way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:284;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:303;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">thoughts prevented him.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:390;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:409;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Ronces-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">valles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:448;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:457;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Mon-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:467;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">talban, especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:477;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:486;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:506;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:515;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knights-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:544;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:563;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his scheme into execution.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:602;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, howev-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:621;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">er, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:641;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:650;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:660;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:669;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:689;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:699;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Gonela, that &quot;tantum pellis et ossa fuit,&quot; surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:708;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse </span></nobr></div>
