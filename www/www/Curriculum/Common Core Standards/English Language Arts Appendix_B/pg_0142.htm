<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy, he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight days </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; whence, as has been al-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ready said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call him-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">self curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">surname from it.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, &quot;If, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady! </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso¡ªshe being of El Toboso¡ªa name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">From Chapter 1</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:458;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of someone or other </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:477;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of their daughters. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:497;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; said his lady to him one day, &quot;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:516;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;But it is,&quot; returned she; &quot;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mr. Bennet made no answer. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Do not you want to know who has taken it?&quot; cried his wife impatiently. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">This was invitation enough. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted </span></nobr></div>
