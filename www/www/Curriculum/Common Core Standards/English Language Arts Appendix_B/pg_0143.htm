<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Is he married or single?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">girls!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;How so? how can it affect them?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; replied his wife, &quot;how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">one of them.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Is that his design in settling here?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">you must visit him as soon as he comes.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:229;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:248;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:258;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:277;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;In such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:297;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:336;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:346;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no new-comers. Indeed you </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:355;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;You are over-scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls: though I must throw in a good </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">word for my little Lizzy.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:414;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:423;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:443;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;They have none of them much to recommend them,&quot; replied he; &quot;they are all silly and ignorant, like other girls; but </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:453;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:472;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way! You take delight in vexing me. You have no compas-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:482;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">sion on my poor nerves.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:501;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">them with consideration these twenty years at least.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:531;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Ah! you do not know what I suffer.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:550;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbour-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:560;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hood.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:619;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:628;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:638;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discon-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:647;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:657;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and news. </span></nobr></div>
