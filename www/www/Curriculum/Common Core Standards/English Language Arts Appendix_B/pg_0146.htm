<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Dostoevsky, Fyodor. Crime and Punishment. Translated by Constance Black Garnett. New York: Dover, 2001. (1866)  </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">ried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">tendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">strained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practi-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">cal importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie¡ªno, rather than that, he would creep down </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:247;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:286;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,&quot; he thought, with an odd smile. &quot;Hm... yes, all is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">in a man's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:305;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. It's </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:315;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this last </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:324;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">plaything.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:373;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer¡ªall </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:411;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">for a moment in the young man's refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:421;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accu-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">rately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">street in such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created sur-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">prise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:517;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was such </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">minded his rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fel-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">low students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">drove past: &quot;Hey there, German hatter&quot; bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him¡ªthe young man stopped </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, how-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">ever, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him. </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Half a mile from home, at the farther edge of the woods, where the land was highest, a great pine-tree stood, the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:652;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">last of its generation. Whether it was left for a boundary mark, or for what reason, no one could say; the woodchop-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:661;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">pers who had felled its mates were dead and gone long ago, and a whole forest of sturdy trees, pines and oaks and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:671;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">maples, had grown again. But the stately head of this old pine towered above them all and made a landmark for sea </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:680;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">and shore miles and miles away. Sylvia knew it well. She had always believed that whoever climbed to the top of it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:690;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">could see the ocean; and the little girl had often laid her hand on the great rough trunk and looked up wistfully at </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:700;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">those dark boughs that the wind always stirred, no matter how hot and still the air might be below. Now she thought </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of the tree with a new excitement, for why, if one climbed it at break of day, could not one see all the world, and easily </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:719;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">discover from whence the white heron flew, and mark the place, and find the hidden nest? </span></nobr></div>
