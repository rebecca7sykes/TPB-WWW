<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">What a spirit of adventure, what wild ambition! What fancied triumph and delight and glory for the later morning </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">when she could make known the secret! It was almost too real and too great for the childish heart to bear. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">All night the door of the little house stood open and the whippoorwills came and sang upon the very step. The young </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">sportsman and his old hostess were sound asleep, but Sylvia's great design kept her broad awake and watching. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">She forgot to think of sleep. The short summer night seemed as long as the winter darkness, and at last when the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">whippoorwills ceased, and she was afraid the morning would after all come too soon, she stole out of the house and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">followed the pasture path through the woods, hastening toward the open ground beyond, listening with a sense of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">comfort and companionship to the drowsy twitter of a half-awakened bird, whose perch she had jarred in passing. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Alas, if the great wave of human interest which flooded for the first time this dull little life should sweep away the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">satisfactions of an existence heart to heart with nature and the dumb life of the forest! </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">There was the huge tree asleep yet in the paling moonlight, and small and silly Sylvia began with utmost bravery to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mount to the top of it, with tingling, eager blood coursing the channels of her whole frame, with her bare feet and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fingers, that pinched and held like bird's claws to the monstrous ladder reaching up, up, almost to the sky itself. First </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">she must mount the white oak tree that grew alongside, where she was almost lost among the dark branches and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">green leaves heavy and wet with dew; a bird fluttered off its nest, and a red squirrel ran to and fro and scolded pet-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:237;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tishly at the harmless housebreaker. Sylvia felt her way easily. She had often climbed there, and knew that higher still </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">one of the oak's upper branches chafed against the pine trunk, just where its lower boughs were set close together. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">There, when she made the dangerous pass from one tree to the other, the great enterprise would really begin. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">She crept out along the swaying oak limb at last, and took the daring step across into the old pine-tree. The way was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">harder than she thought; she must reach far and hold fast, the sharp dry twigs caught and held her and scratched her </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">like angry talons, the pitch made her thin little fingers clumsy and stiff as she went round and round the tree's great </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">stem, higher and higher upward. The sparrows and robins in the woods below were beginning to wake and twitter </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to the dawn, yet it seemed much lighter there aloft in the pine-tree, and the child knew she must hurry if her project </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">were to be of any use. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The tree seemed to lengthen itself out as she went up, and to reach farther and farther upward. It was like a great </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">main-mast to the voyaging earth; it must truly have been amazed that morning through all its ponderous frame as it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:362;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">felt this determined spark of human spirit wending its way from higher branch to branch. Who knows how steadily </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the least twigs held themselves to advantage this light, weak creature on her way! The old pine must have loved his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">new dependent. More than all the hawks, and bats, and moths, and even the sweet voiced thrushes, was the brave, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">beating heart of the solitary gray-eyed child. And the tree stood still and frowned away the winds that June morning </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:401;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">while the dawn grew bright in the east. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Sylvia's face was like a pale star, if one had seen it from the ground, when the last thorny bough was past, and she </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">stood trembling and tired but wholly triumphant, high in the tree-top. Yes, there was the sea with the dawning sun </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">making a golden dazzle over it, and toward that glorious east flew two hawks with slow-moving pinions. How low </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they looked in the air from that height when one had only seen them before far up, and dark against the blue sky. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Their gray feathers were as soft as moths; they seemed only a little way from the tree, and Sylvia felt as if she too </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">could go flying away among the clouds. Westward, the woodlands and farms reached miles and miles into the dis-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:478;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tance; here and there were church steeples, and white villages, truly it was a vast and awesome world. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:506;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Melville, Herman. Billy Budd, Sailor. New York: Penguin, 1986. (1886)</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:516;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">From Chapter 26</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">At sea in the old time, the execution by halter of a military sailor was generally from the fore-yard. In the present </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:545;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">instance, for special reasons the main-yard was assigned. Under an arm of that lee-yard the prisoner was presently </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">brought up, the Chaplain attending him. It was noted at the time and remarked upon afterwards, that in this final </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:564;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">scene the good man evinced little or nothing of the perfunctory. Brief speech indeed he had with the condemned </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:574;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">one, but the genuine Gospel was less on his tongue than in his aspect and manner towards him. The final prepara-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tions personal to the latter being speedily brought to an end by two boatswain's mates, the consummation impended. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Billy stood facing aft. At the penultimate moment, his words, his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the ut-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:603;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">terance were these -- &quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot; Syllables so unanticipated coming from one with the ignominious </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hemp about his neck -- a conventional felon's benediction directed aft towards the quarters of honor; syllables too </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">delivered in the clear melody of a singing-bird on the point of launching from the twig, had a phenomenal effect, not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:632;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">unenhanced by the rare personal beauty of the young sailor spiritualized now thro' late experiences so poignantly </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:641;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">profound.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:661;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Without volition as it were, as if indeed the ship's populace were but the vehicles of some vocal current electric, with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:670;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">one voice from alow and aloft came a resonant sympathetic echo -- &quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot; And yet at that instant </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:680;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Billy alone must have been in their hearts, even as he was in their eyes.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:700;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">At the pronounced words and the spontaneous echo that voluminously rebounded them, Captain Vere, either thro' </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">stoic self-control or a sort of momentary paralysis induced by emotional shock, stood erectly rigid as a musket in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:719;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ship-armorer's rack.</span></nobr></div>
