<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">gloves in his study, looked at the governess who was making this statement and laughed.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'So Seriozha has been smoking!' he said with a shrug of his shoulders. 'Fancy the little beggar with a cigarette in his </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'Seven years old. It seems of small consequence to you, but at his age smoking is a bad, a harmful habit; and bad </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">When the governess had gone, Bilovsky sat down in an easy-chair before his writing-table and began to think. For </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">some reason he pictured to himself his Seriozha enveloped in clouds of tobacco smoke, with a huge, yard-long ciga-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:402;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">rette in his mouth, and this caricature made him smile. At the same time the earnest, anxious face of the governess </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:412;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">awakened in him memories of days long past and half-forgotten, when smoking at school and in the nursery aroused </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:422;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in masters and parents a strange, almost incomprehensible horror. It really was horror. Children were unmercifully </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:431;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">flogged, and expelled from school, and their lives were blighted, although not one of the teachers nor fathers knew </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">exactly what constituted the harm and offence of smoking. Even very intelligent people did not hesitate to combat </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the vice they did not understand. Bilovsky called to mind the principal of his school, a highly educated, good-natured </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">old man, who was so shocked when he caught a scholar with a cigarette that he would turn pale and immediately </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">summon a special session of the school board and sentence the offender to expulsion. No doubt that is one of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">laws of society〞the less an evil is understood the more bitterly and harshly it is attacked.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:499;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The attorney thought of the two or three boys who had been expelled and of their subsequent lives, and could not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">but reflect that punishment is, in many cases, more productive of evil than crime itself. The living organism possesses </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:518;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the faculty of quickly adapting itself to every condition; if it were not so man would be conscious every moment of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:528;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the unreasonable foundations on which his reasonable actions rest and how little of justice and assurance are to be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:537;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">found even in those activities which are fraught with so much responsibility and which are so appalling in their conse-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quences, such as education, literature, the law〞</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">And thoughts such as these came floating into Bilovsky's head; light, evanescent thoughts such as only enter weary, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">resting brains. One knows not whence they are nor why they come; they stay but a short while and seem to spread </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">across the surface of the brain without ever sinking very far into its depths. For those whose minds for hours and days </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">together are forced to be occupied with business and to travel always along the same lines, these homelike, untram-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">melled musings bring a sort of comfort and a pleasant restfulness of their own.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:624;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It was nine o'clock. On the floor overhead someone was pacing up and down, and still higher up, on the third storey, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">four hands were playing scales on the piano. The person who was pacing the floor seemed, from his nervous strides, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to be the victim of tormenting thoughts or of the toothache; his footsteps and the monotonous scales added to the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quiet of the evening something somnolent that predisposed the mind to idle reveries.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:673;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In the nursery, two rooms away, Seriozha and his governess were talking.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:712;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'Votre p豕re vous appelle, allez vite!' cried the governess, twittering like a frightened bird.</span></nobr></div>
