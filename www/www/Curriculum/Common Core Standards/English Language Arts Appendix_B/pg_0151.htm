<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;Before unearthing this letter, I had questioned myself about the ways in which a book can be infinite. I could think of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">nothing other than a cyclic volume, a circular one. A book whose last page was identical with the first, a book which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">had the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I remembered too that night which is at the middle of the Thousand and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">One Nights when Scheherazade (through a magical oversight of the copyist) begins to relate word for word the story </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of the Thousand and One Nights, establishing the risk of coming once again to the night when she must repeat it, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">thus on to infinity. I imagined as well a Platonic, hereditary work, transmitted from father to son, in which each new </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">individual adds a chapter or corrects with pious care the pages of his elders. These conjectures diverted me; but none </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">seemed to correspond, not even remotely, to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. In the midst of this perplexity, I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">received from Oxford the manuscript you have examined. I lingered, naturally, on the sentence: I leave to the various </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">futures (not to all) my garden o f forking paths. Almost instantly, I understood: `the garden of forking paths' was the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">chaotic novel; the phrase `the various futures (not to all)' suggested to me the forking in time, not in space. A broad </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">rereading of the work confirmed the theory. In all fictional works, each time a man is confronted with several alterna-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">tives, he chooses one and eliminates the others; in the fiction of Ts'ui Pen, he chooses simultaneously-all of them. He </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">creates, in this way, diverse futures, diverse times which themselves also proliferate and fork. Here, then, is the ex-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">planation of the novel's contradictions. Fang, let us say, has a secret; a stranger calls at his door; Fang resolves to kill </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">him. Naturally, there are several possible outcomes: Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, they both can </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">escape, they both can die, and so forth. In the work of Ts'ui Pen, all possible outcomes occur; each one is the point of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">departure for other forkings. Sometimes, the paths of this labyrinth converge: for example, you arrive at this house, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">but in one of the possible pasts you are my enemy, in another, my friend. If you will resign yourself to my incurable </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:430;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;Well, what's the matter with you? Yes, I'd marry an older woman. Why not?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;I bet you wouldn't.&quot; He was still able to amaze me, as though we had remained kids.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;We don't have to argue about it because she's not old. She's about twenty-two, I'm told.&quot;</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:645;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">&quot;Cold-blooded!&quot; he said with sudden emotion. &quot;What's cold-blooded about it? I'd be cold-blooded if I stayed as I am. </span></nobr></div>
