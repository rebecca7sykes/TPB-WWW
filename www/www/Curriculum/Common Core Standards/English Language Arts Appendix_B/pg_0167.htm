<div style="position:absolute;top:421;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">'Tis hard to mesmerize ourselves, to whip our own top; but through sympathy we are capable of energy and endur-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:431;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ance. Concert fires people to a certain fury of performance they can rarely reach alone. Here is the use of society: it is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">so easy with the great to be great; so easy to come up to an existing standard;¡ªas easy as it is to the lover to swim to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his maiden through waves so grim before. The benefits of affection are immense; and the one event which never loses </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">its romance, is the encounter with superior persons on terms allowing the happiest intercourse.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It by no means follows that we are not fit for society, because soir¨¦es are tedious, and because the soir¨¦e finds us </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:489;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tedious. A backwoodsman, who had been sent to the university, told me that, when he heard the best-bred young </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:499;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">men at the law school talk together, he reckoned himself a boor; but whenever he caught them apart, and had one to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:508;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">himself alone, then they were the boors, and he the better man. And if we recall the rare hours when we encountered </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:518;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the best persons, we then found ourselves, and then first society seemed to exist. That was society, though in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:527;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">transom of a brig, or on the Florida Keys.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A cold, sluggish blood thinks it has not facts enough to the purpose, and must decline its turn in the conversation. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But they who speak have no more,¡ªhave less. 'Tis not new facts that avail, but the heat to dissolve everybody's facts. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The capital defect of cold, arid natures is the want of animal spirits. They seem a power incredible, as if God should </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">raise the dead. The recluse witnesses what others perform by their aid, with a kind of fear. It is as much out of his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:585;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">possibility as the prowess of C?ur-de-Lion, or an Irishman's day's-work on the railroad. 'Tis said, the present and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">future are always rivals. Animal spirits constitute the power of the present, and their feats are like the structure of a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:605;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">pyramid. Their result is a lord, a general, or a boon companion. Before these, what a base mendicant is Memory with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">his leathern badge! But this genial heat is latent in all constitutions, and is disengaged only by the friction of society. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:624;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">As Bacon said of manners, &quot;To obtain them, it only needs not to despise them,&quot; so we say of animal spirits, that they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">are the spontaneous product of health and of a social habit. &quot;For behavior, men learn it, as they take diseases, one of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">another.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But the people are to be taken in very small doses. If solitude is proud, so is society vulgar. In society, high advan-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:672;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tages are set down to the individual as disqualifications. We sink as easily as we rise, through sympathy. So many men </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:682;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">whom I know are degraded by their sympathies, their native aims being high enough, but their relation all too tender </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:691;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to the gross people about them. Men cannot afford to live together by their merits, and they adjust themselves by </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:701;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">their demerits,¡ªby their love of gossip, or by sheer tolerance and animal good-nature. They untune and dissipate the </span></nobr></div>
