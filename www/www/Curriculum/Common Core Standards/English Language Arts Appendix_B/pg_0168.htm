<div style="position:absolute;top:73;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The remedy is, to reinforce each of these moods from the other. Conversation will not corrupt us, if we come to the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">assembly in our own garb and speech, and with the energy of health to select what is ours and reject what is not. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Society we must have; but let it be society, and not exchanging news, or eating from the same dish. Is it society to sit </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in one of your chairs? I cannot go into the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone. Society </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">exists by chemical affinity, and not otherwise.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Put any company of people together with freedom for conversation, and a rapid self-distribution takes place, into </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">sets and pairs. The best are accused of exclusiveness. It would be more true to say, they separate as oil from water, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as children from old people, without love or hatred in the matter, each seeking his like; and any interference with the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">affinities would produce constraint and suffocation. All conversation is a magnetic experiment. I know that my friend </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">can talk eloquently; you know that he cannot articulate a sentence: we have seen him in different company. Assort </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">your party, or invite none. Put Stubbs and Coleridge, Quintilian and Aunt Miriam, into pairs, and you make them all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wretched. 'Tis an extempore Sing-Sing built in a parlor. Leave them to seek their own mates, and they will be as merry </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A higher civility will re-establish in our customs a certain reverence which we have lost. What to do with these brisk </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ties would pronounce themselves with a surer reciprocity.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Here again, as so often, Nature delights to put us between extreme antagonisms, and our safety is in the skill with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which we keep the diagonal line. Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal. We must keep our head in the one and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">our hands in the other. The conditions are met, if we keep our independence, yet do not lose our sympathy. These </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:295;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands. We require such a solitude as shall hold us to its revelations when </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">we are in the street and in palaces; for most men are cowed in society, and say good things to you in private, but will </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:314;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">not stand to them in public. But let us not be the victims of words. Society and solitude are deceptive names. It is not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the circumstance of seeing more or fewer people, but the readiness of sympathy, that imports; and a sound mind will </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">derive its principles from insight, with ever a purer ascent to the sufficient and absolute right, and will accept society </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as the natural element in which they are to be applied.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:390;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">From &quot;Lee Surrenders to Grant, April 9th, 1865&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">When Lee came to the sentence about the officers' side-arms, private horses &amp; baggage, he showed for the first time </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">during the reading of the letter a slight change of countenance &amp; was evidently touched by this act of generosity. It </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">was doubtless the condition mentioned to which he particularly alluded when he looked toward General Grant, as he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">finished reading &amp; said with some degree of warmth in his manner, 'This will have a very happy effect upon my army.'&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:458;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">General Grant then said: &quot;Unless you have some suggestions to make in regard to the form in which I have stated the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">terms, I will have a copy of the letter made in ink, and sign it.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;There is one thing I should like to mention,&quot; Lee replied, after a short pause. &quot;The cavalrymen and artillerists own </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:497;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">their own horses in our army. Its organization in this respect differs from that of the United States.&quot; This expression </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">attracted the notice of our officers present, as showing how firmly the conviction was grounded in his mind that we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:516;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">were two distinct countries. He continued: &quot;I should like to understand whether these men will be permitted to retain </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:526;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">their horses.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;You will find that the terms as written do not allow this,&quot; General Grant replied; &quot;only the officers are permitted to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">take their private property.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Lee read over the second page of the letter again, and then said: &quot;No, I see the terms do not allow it; that is clear.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">His face showed plainly that he was quite anxious to have this concession made; and Grant said very promptly, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">without giving Lee time to make a direct request: </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, the subject is quite new to me. Of course I did not know that any private soldiers owned their animals; but I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">think we have fought the last battle of the war,¡ªI sincerely hope so,¡ªand that the surrender of this army will be fol-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lowed soon by that of all the others; and I take it that most of the men in the ranks are small farmers, and as the coun-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">try has been so raided by the two armies, it is doubtful whether they will be able to put in a crop to carry themselves </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:652;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and their families through the next winter without the aid of the horses they are now riding, and I will arrange it in this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:662;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">way: I will not change the terms as now written, but I will instruct the officers I shall appoint to receive the paroles to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:671;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">let all the men who claim to own a horse or mule take the animals home with them to work their little farms.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
