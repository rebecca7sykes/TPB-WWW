<div style="position:absolute;top:92;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">There has appeared in our time a particular class of books and articles which I sincerely and solemnly think may be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">called the silliest ever known among men. They are much more wild than the wildest romances of chivalry and much </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:111;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">more dull than the dullest religious tract. Moreover, the romances of chivalry were at least about chivalry; the reli-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">gious tracts are about religion. But these things are about nothing; they are about what is called Success. On every </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">bookstall, in every magazine, you may find works telling people how to succeed. They are books showing men how to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">succeed in everything; they are written by men who cannot even succeed in writing books. To begin with, of course, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">there is no such thing as Success. Or, if you like to put it so, there is nothing that is not successful. That a thing is suc-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">cessful merely means that it is; a millionaire is successful in being a millionaire and a donkey in being a donkey. Any </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">live man has succeeded in living; any dead man may have succeeded in committing suicide. But, passing over the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">bad logic and bad philosophy in the phrase, we may take it, as these writers do, in the ordinary sense of success in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">obtaining money or worldly position. These writers profess to tell the ordinary man how he may succeed in his trade </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">or speculation¡ªhow, if he is a builder, he may succeed as a builder; how, if he is a stockbroker, he may succeed as a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">stockbroker. They profess to show him how, if he is a grocer, he may become a sporting yachtsman; how, if he is a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">tenth-rate journalist, he may become a peer; and how, if he is a German Jew, he may become an Anglo-Saxon. This </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">is a definite and business-like proposal, and I really think that the people who buy these books (if any people do buy </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:236;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">them) have a moral, if not a legal, right to ask for their money back. Nobody would dare to publish a book about elec-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">tricity which literally told one nothing about electricity; no one would dare publish an article on botany which showed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:255;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">that the writer did not know which end of a plant grew in the earth. Yet our modern world is full of books about Suc-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">cess and successful people which literally contain no kind of idea, and scarcely and kind of verbal sense. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:285;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">It is perfectly obvious that in any decent occupation (such as bricklaying or writing books) there are only two ways (in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:294;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">any special sense) of succeeding. One is by doing very good work, the other is by cheating. Both are much too simple </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:304;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">to require any literary explanation. If you are in for the high jump, either jump higher than any one else, or manage </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:313;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">somehow to pretend that you have done so. If you want to succeed at whist, either be a good whist-player, or play </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">with marked cards. You may want a book about jumping; you may want a book about whist; you may want a book </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:333;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">about cheating at whist. But you cannot want a book about Success. Especially you cannot want a book about Suc-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">cess such as those which you can now find scattered by the hundred about the book-market. You may want to jump </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">or to play cards; but you do not want to read wandering statements to the effect that jumping is jumping, or that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">games are won by winners. If these writers, for instance, said anything about success in jumping it would be some-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">thing like this: 'The jumper must have a clear aim before him. He must desire definitely to jump higher than the other </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">men who are in for the same competition. He must let no feeble feelings of mercy (sneaked from the sickening Little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:390;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Englanders and Pro-Boers) prevent him from trying to do his best. He must remember that a competition in jumping </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">is distinctly competitive, and that, as Darwin has gloriously demonstrated, THE WEAKEST GO TO THE WALL.' That is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:409;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">the kind of thing the book would say, and very useful it would be, no doubt, if read out in a low and tense voice to a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">young man just about to take the high jump. Or suppose that in the course of his intellectual rambles the philosopher </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of Success dropped upon our other case, that of playing cards, his bracing advice would run¡ª'In playing cards it is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">very necessary to avoid the mistake (commonly made by maudlin humanitarians and Free Traders) of permitting your </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:448;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">opponent to win the game. You must have grit and snap and go in to win. The days of idealism and superstition are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:457;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">over. We live in a time of science and hard common sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:467;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">where two are playing IF ONE DOES NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL.' It is all very stirring, of course; but I confess that if I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:477;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">were playing cards I would rather have some decent little book which told me the rules of the game. Beyond the rules </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:486;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of the game it is all a question either of talent or dishonesty; and I will undertake to provide either one or the other¡ª</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:496;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">which, it is not for me to say.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">What chiefly lies behind (slang) is simply a kind of linguistic exuberance, an excess of word-making energy. It relates </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:563;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">itself to the standard language a great deal as dancing relates itself to music. But there is also something else. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">best slang is not only ingenious and amusing; it also embodies a kind of social criticism. It not only provides new </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:582;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">names for a series of every-day concepts, some new and some old; it also says something about them. &quot;Words which </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:592;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">produce the slang effect,&quot; observes Frank Sechrist, &quot;arouse associations what are incongruous or incompatible with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:602;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">those of customary thinking.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:621;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Everyone, including the metaphysician in his study or the eremite in his cell, has a large vocabulary of slang, but the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">vocabulary of the vulgar is likely to be larger than that of the cultured, and it is harder worked. Its content may be di-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:640;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">vided into two categories: (a) old words, whether used singly or in combination, that have been put to new uses, usu-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:650;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">ally metaphorical, and (b) new words that have not yet been admitted to the standard vocabulary. Examples of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:660;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">first type are rubberneck, for a gaping and prying person, and iceberg, for a cold woman; examples of the second are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:669;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">hoosegow, flim-flam, blurb, bazoo and blah. There is a constant movement of slang into accepted usage. Nice, as an </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:708;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">in, fill the bill and to fly off the handle, once viewed askance, have gradually worked their way to a relatively high level </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:717;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">of the standard speech. On some indeterminate tomorrow to stick up and to take for a ride may follow them.</span></nobr></div>
