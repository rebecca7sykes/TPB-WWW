<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">the meaning of the words¡­Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for here they were. Then maybe, perhaps, I could </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">use them as a weapon? No. It frightened me. I read on and what amazed me was not what he said, but how on earth </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Lincoln was shaken by the presidency. Back in Springfield, politics had been a sort of exhilarating game; but in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:352;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">White House, politics was power, and power was responsibility. Never before had Lincoln held executive office. In </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">cisions in themselves had neither finality nor importance. As President he might consult with others, but innumerable </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">grave decisions were in the end his own, and with them came a burden of responsibility terrifying in its dimensions.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Lincoln's rage for personal success, his external and worldly ambition, was quieted when he entered the White House, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">and he was at last left alone to reckon with himself. To be confronted with the fruits of his victory only to find that it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">meant choosing between life and death for others was immensely sobering. That Lincoln should have shouldered the </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:544;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">Just last week, I was walking down the street with my mother, and I again found myself conscious of the English I was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">using, the English I do use with her. We were talking about the price of new and used furniture and I heard myself say-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:564;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">ing this: &quot;Not waste money that way.&quot; My husband was with us as well, and he didn't notice any switch in my English. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">And then I realized why. It's because over the twenty years we've been together I've often used that same kind of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:583;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">English with him, and sometimes he even uses it with me. It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:592;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">English that relates to family talk, the language I grew up with.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">So you'll have some idea of what this family talk I heard sounds like, I'll quote what my mother said during a recent </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">conversation which I videotaped and then transcribed. During this conversation, my mother was talking about a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">political gangster in Shanghai who had the same last name as her family's, Du, and how the gangster in his early years </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:641;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">wanted to be adopted by her family, which was rich by comparison. Later, the gangster became more powerful, far </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:650;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">richer than my mother's family, and one day showed up at my mother's wedding to pay his respects. Here's what </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:660;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">she said in part: &quot;Du Yusong having business like fruit stand. Like off the street kind. He is Du like Du Zong¡ªbut not </span></nobr></div>
