<div style="position:absolute;top:124;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">The remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of Anglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:134;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">result (and this should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct elements), which in other places have been in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">frequent hostility, but which in America have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another. I allude to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the spirit of Religion and the spirit of Liberty.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">The settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians and daring innovators. Narrow as the limits of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:182;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">some of their religious opinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence arose two tendencies, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">distinct but not opposite, which are constantly discernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">It might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their family, and their native land to a religious convic-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">tion were absorbed in the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at so dear a rate. The energy, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:230;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">however, with which they strove for the acquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as liberties </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:240;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">of the world, is scarcely inferior to that with which they devoted themselves to Heaven.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:260;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Political principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded and altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:269;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">society in which they were born were broken down before them; the old principles which had governed the world for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:279;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">ages were no more; a path without a turn and a field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">curiosity of man: but at the limits of the political world he checks his researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:298;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">his most formidable faculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully abstaining from raising the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:308;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with submissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in the moral world </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in the political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:327;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">disputed: in the one is a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an independence scornful of experience </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:336;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">and jealous of authority.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:356;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">These two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from conflicting; they advance together, and mutually support </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:366;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">each other. Religion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the faculties of man, and that the political </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">world is a field prepared by the Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the freedom and the power </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the place which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely es-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">tablished than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by aught beside its native strength. Religion is no less </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:404;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:414;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom.</span></nobr></div>
