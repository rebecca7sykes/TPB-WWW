<div style="position:absolute;top:178;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:284;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:322;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, is American slavery. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:341;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the slave's point of view. Standing there identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:351;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:370;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:380;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:389;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:399;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Bible which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:409;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery the great sin and shame of America! &quot;I will not equivocate; I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:418;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">will not excuse&quot;; I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:540"><nobr><span class="ft1"></span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:437;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"> </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:447;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, &quot;It is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:457;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, an denounce less; would you persuade </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:466;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">more, and rebuke less; your cause would be much more likely to succeed.&quot; But, I submit, where all is plain there is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:476;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:485;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:495;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their govern-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:505;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ment. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the State of Virginia which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punish-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:524;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:533;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">acknowledgment that the slave is a moral, intellectual, and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:543;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:553;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws in reference to the beasts </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:562;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:572;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:581;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!  </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:591;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"> </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:601;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:610;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ploughing, planting, and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:620;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and ciphering, acting </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:629;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:639;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:649;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:658;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian's God, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:668;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!  </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:687;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? That he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:706;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the </span></nobr></div>
