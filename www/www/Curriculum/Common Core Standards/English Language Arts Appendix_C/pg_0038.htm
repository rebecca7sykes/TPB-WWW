<div style="position:absolute;top:117;left:229"><nobr><span class="ft3">A Pet Story About My Cat . . . Gus</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  People get pets so that they will never be lonely, and they will always have a friend to be there for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">them. Ask your heart, what makes the best pet??? Some people think a best pet is picky, energetic, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">sneaky, but I think my pet is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he's playful, and he loves me! Gus was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">about eight weeks old when we got him, now he is 4 1/2 months old, and he is about as big as a size eight </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">sneaker. He is a little gray and white kitten. If you look closely he has a gray tail, but there are darker gray </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">rings around it. He has a little white on his face, and some on his tummy and paws. He has a little stripe on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his leg but it is his back left leg only. He's very cute, and he purrs a lot! He also has a cute little gray nose.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  One of the reasons why my cat Gus is the best pet is because he is a cuddle bug. When Gus </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">was a baby, he had to be kept in a cage because he wasn't allowed to interact with the other pets until </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:245;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">he was older. He couldn't interact with the other pets because when Twister was a baby, the ferrets </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">bit her ear and dragged her under the bed, and bit her in the back of the neck and we didn't want the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">same thing to happen to Gus. Also because Twister had to be kept in a cage when she was little, too. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">His cage was in my room so when he meowed, as if to say, &quot;Get me out!&quot; I would have to take him out </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and sleep with him. All he would do is thank me for doing that by snuggling against my chin! Another </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">example to prove that Gus is a cuddle bug, is that when I'm feeding Gus, I put his and Twister's bowl </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">up on the counter when I do so, and Twister sits there patiently while Gus is snuggling against my legs </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to show affection toward me. He snuggles my leg even when I'm walking around! Well, at least he tries </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to, because he follows me, and when I stop walking, he starts to cuddle. Eventually I pick him up and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">cuddle him back!!! Finally, when I have nothing to do and I'm just sitting on my bed reading, Gus jumps </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">up with me and then he pushes away the covers to get under them, and he sleeps on my chest to keep </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">my company when I'm board. After he slept on my tummy many times, he finally got the nickname </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">__________ Cuddle Buddy. Now I always snuggle with my favorite cuddle buddy . . . Gus!!!</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  A second reason why Gus is the best pet is because he's playful. Most of the time when Gus </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">is lying on the couch minding his own business, I'll reach out to pet him then he'll start biting my hand </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and attacking it!!! He does this to be playful, not to hurt anyone but he just wants to have fun. It kind of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tickles when he does it, actually. Gus also has a little toy mouse that is attached to a string that I drag </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">around the house so that Gus will follow it. The mouse has a leopard skin pattern on it with balls of fur </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">as hands and feet. The mouse is about the size of the pencil sharpeners in Mrs. __________ classroom. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">He goes after that mouse so fast that it's hard to see him running by to catch it. When Gus was a baby, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">I would put him in my bed to sleep with, but before we went to sleep, I would move my feet around </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:482;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">underneath the covers, while Gus was on top chasing them around. Eventually, he got tired and lied </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">down near my feet, but before he was completely asleep, I would pick him up and put him near my </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:504;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">pillow and we slept together. Gus loves doing that all the time. I love how Gus is so playful!!!</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  The last reason why Gus is the best pet is because he loves me! He always misses me whenever </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">I'm not there. When I come home from school and I open the door, Gus comes flying around the corner, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and starts to climb my pants! When he gets high enough. I grab him in my arms and we start cuddling </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">each other while Gus is happily purring. He does this a lot. Most of the time I'm in my room watching TV, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">while Gus and Twister are fighting and killing each other, they come dashing around the corner and into </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">my room. I, of course, have to break up the fight. After that, I put them on my bed and hold them down, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">but they keep squirming. Soon, they get tired and sleep with me, silently, watching TV. Gus is with me as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:600;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">much as possible. Sometimes he's busy playing with Twister, sleeping, or eating. Otherwise, he's playing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:611;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">or sleeping with me. We do so many things together and I'm glad I got him, but technically, he chose me. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was a homeless cat shelter. They were able to catch the kittens, but not there mommy. His brothers </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and sisters were all playing, but he was sleeping under the table. Soon, he walked out from under the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">table and slept with me while we cuddled on the couch. That's how I met Gus.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:664;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">People have feelings for their pets that show that they love them very much. When I had to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:675;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">decide what makes the best pet, I would say that Gus is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he's </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:686;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">playful, and he loves me. When you think about the examples that I gave you, like when I told you about </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">how Gus snuggles against my chin, you saw that Gus </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:310"><nobr><span class="ft4">IS</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:319"><nobr><span class="ft2"> the best pet and if you don't believe me, you </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:707;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have a problem with deciding who the best pet is. </span></nobr></div>
