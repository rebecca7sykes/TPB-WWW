<div style="position:absolute;top:97;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">This analysis of a work of literature was completed as a homework assignment for an English class.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:117;left:249"><nobr><span class="ft3">The Old Man and the Sea</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  In the book The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway tells the story of an old Cuban </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">fisherman named Santiago who, considered by the villagers to be the worst type of unlucky, is still </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">determined to win a battle against a giant Marlin off the coast of Cuba. Santiago succeeds, but his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">successes do not come without great hardship and struggle. He spends three days being dragged in his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">skiff by the enormous marlin with minimal food and water, all the while enduring acute physical pain, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tiredness, and an unending loneliness due to the absence of his young friend, Manolin. It is only after </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Santiago's prize fish is completely devoured by sharks that he returns home to the village scorners and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the safety of Manolin's trust. As his suffering and loss compound, we can see that Hemingway's quote &quot;a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">man can be destroyed but not defeated&quot; offers a key insight into Santiago's life.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:245;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  As the story begins, we learn that Santiago has gone eighty-four days straight without catching </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a fish. Young Manolin's parents will no longer allow the two to fish together, for they do not want their </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">son being exposed any more to this type of failure. Santiago and Manolin are deeply saddened by this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">news, but Santiago does not let the loss of his friend or the defeat that others see him suffering keep </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">him off the sea. Rather, with bright and shining eyes he thinks &quot;maybe today. Every day is a new day&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">(pg. 32), and prepares to catch the biggest fish of his life. This shows that even though almost all of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Santiago's acquaintances feel that his fishing career is over, he sees it about to reach its all time high. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Though he knows he is physically older and weaker than most of his fellow fisherman, he refuses to let </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">their opinions and stereotypes destroy his confidence and determination.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  As the story progresses, Hemingway presents an even more vivid picture of Santiago refusing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to be destroyed by the forces that threaten to defeat him. Even after he accomplishes the difficult task </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">of hooking the giant Marlin, he finds his skiff being dragged by the fish for over two days. Living in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the small boat is no easy task for Santiago, and soon injury and suffering seem to take over his entire </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">body. His back is sore from sitting so long against the stiff wood, his face is cut from fishing hooks, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his shoulders ache, and his eyes have trouble focusing. Most difficult to endure though is the terrible </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">condition in which he finds his hands. The left one is weakened from a period of being tightly cramped, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and both are extremely mutilated from the burn of the moving fishing line. It would have been so much </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">easier for Santiago to simply give up and release the fish, yet he knows that if he endures a little longer, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">victory will be his. Even when it seems he has no effort left, Santiago promises himself &quot;I'll try it again.&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">(pg. 93) This is Santiago's real inner determination coming through. He has encountered so many </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">obstacles during the past few days, yet he will not let them defeat his dream of killing the fish. There </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:482;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">is no outside force promising a splendid reward if he succeeds, only those that threaten to ridicule him </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">if he is destroyed. Santiago is working solely on his own desire to fulfill his dream and prove to himself </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:504;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">that, although his struggles may cost him his life, he can accomplish even the seemingly impossible.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  After three long days and nights, Santiago's determination pays off, and at last he manages to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">catch and kill the Marlin. It is only a very short time that he has to relish in his triumph though, for a few </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">hours later vicious sharks begin to destroy the carcass of the great fish. For hours, Santiago manages </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to ward them off, but this time it is not he who wins the final battle. Spirits low and pain at an all time </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">high, Santiago returns to the village, towing behind him only the bare skeleton of a treasure that once </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">was. It seems as though Santiago is ready to just curl up and die, and indeed he has reason to feel this </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">way. Yet as he rests alone and talk with Manolin, we see a hint of Santiago's determination, that has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:600;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">characterized his personality throughout the entire story, begin to shine through. Upon reaching home, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:611;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">he begins to make plans with Manolin about future adventures they will have together. Hemingway tells </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">us that Santiago, in his youth, had loved to watch the majestic lions along his home on a white sand </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">beach in Africa, and he still returns to those dreams when searching for contentment. That night, as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Santiago drifts off to sleep, Hemingway tells that he was indeed &quot;dreaming about the lions.&quot; (pg. 127) </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:654;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">This is perhaps the truest test of how much courage and determination a person has. If even when they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:665;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have suffered the biggest defeat of their life, they are able to look to the future and realize the wonderful </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:676;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">things they still posses. Though the forces of nature and time destroyed Santiago's prize fish, he refuses </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:687;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to let that fact ruin the rest of his life. No one can take away his love for Manolin or memories of what </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">once was, and because of this, no one can ever truly defeat Santiago.</span></nobr></div>
