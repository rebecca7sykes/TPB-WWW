<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">John Boyne's story, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, tells the tale of an incredible friendship between </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">two eight-year old boys during the Holocaust. One of the boys is Bruno, the son of an important German </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">commander who is put in charge of Auschwitz Camp, and the other is Shmuel, a Jewish boy inside the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">camp. Throughout the story their forbidden friendship grows, and the two boys unknowingly break the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">incredible racial boundaries of the time. They remain best friends until Bruno goes under the fence to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">help Shmuel find his father when they are both killed in the gas showers of the camp. By comparing and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">contrasting supporting characters, irony, and the themes in the movie and the book, it is clear that the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (Mark Herman, 2008) is not nearly as good as the novel of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">same title.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Characterization is very important to a story and influences how a person interprets the novel or movie, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and one important way that the book differs from the movie is how Bruno's mother is characterized. In </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the movie, she is unrealistically portrayed as an honest woman with good moral values, and is almost as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">naive as Bruno is about what is going on at Auschwitz. When she discovers what her husband is doing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to people at the camp she is deeply disturbed. Mortified by her husband's cruelty, their relationship </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">declines. In contrast, she is a far more sinister character in the book. Though Bruno is too young to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">understand what his mother is doing, one of the reasons he dislikes Lieutenant Kotler is that, &quot; . . . he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">was always in the living room with Mother and making jokes with her, and Mother laughed at his jokes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">more than she laughed at Father's&quot; (162). Bruno's mother is very unhappy in her new situation away </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">from Berlin, and her discontent leads her to cheat on her husband. This also leads her to unknowingly </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">hurt her son, for Bruno is upset that she is paying more attention to Lieutenant Kotler than she is to his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:386;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">father, and the damage she causes could be magnified if she continues to disrupt their family. Further </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:397;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">examples of her abysmal character and unfaithfulness are revealed when Bruno's mother finds the young </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">lieutenant and says, &quot;Oh Kurt, precious, you're still here . . . I have a little free time now if¡ªOh! she said, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:418;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">noticing Bruno standing there. 'Bruno! What are you doing here?'&quot;(166). Her disloyalty further allows </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the reader to see that her character is far from virtuous, contrary to the opinion of a person who viewed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the movie. Throughout the story, it also becomes apparent that Bruno's mother is also an alcoholic, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:451;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and, &quot;Bruno worried for her health because he'd never known anyone to need quite so many medicinal </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">sherries&quot; (188). Unable to come to terms with her new circumstances and strained relationship with </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:472;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">her husband, Bruno's mother tries to drink away her problems, further conveying that she is a weak </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:483;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">character. Bruno's extreme innocence about his mother and situation at Auschwitz are magnified by the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:494;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">use of irony in both the movie and the book. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:515;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">In some ways the book and the movie have similar aspects, and one of these aspects is how irony is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">used to emphasize Bruno's innocence and to greatly emphasize the tragic mood of the story. In the final </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">climactic scene of the movie¡ªjust after Bruno has gone under the fence to help Shmuel find his father¡ª</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the two boys are led to the gas showers to be killed. Unaware of what is about to happen to them, Bruno </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tells Shmuel that his father must have ordered this so it must be for a good reason, and that they are going </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">into the air-tight rooms to stay out of the rain and avoid getting sick. This statement is incredibly ironic </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">because, unbeknownst to Bruno, his father has unknowingly commenced his own son's death sentence. In </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:590;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">addition to this, the soldiers have no intention of keeping their prisoners healthy. It never occurs to Bruno </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:601;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">that anyone would want to destroy another human being or treat them badly, and his innocence makes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his premature death all the more tragic. Although the movie may be incredibly ironic in a few specific </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">instances, the book contains a plethora of ironic events that also accentuate Bruno's childishness and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">naivety. A profound example of this is exhibited when Bruno thinks to himself that, &quot; . . . he did like stripes </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and he felt increasingly fed up that he had to wear trousers and shirts and ties and shoes that were too </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:655;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tight for him when Shmuel and his friends got to wear striped pajamas all day long&quot; (155). Bruno has no </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:666;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">clue that the people in the &quot;striped pajamas&quot; are being cruelly treated and murdered, and is jealous of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:677;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">what he thinks is freedom. Bruno once again reveals his innocence when he asks Pavel, the Jewish man </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:687;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">from the camp who cleans him up after a fall, &quot;If you're a doctor, then why are you waiting on tables? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:698;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Why aren't you working at a hospital somewhere?&quot; (83). It is a mystery to Bruno that a doctor would be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">reduced to such a state for no transparent reason, and his beliefs should be what all adults think. Though </span></nobr></div>
