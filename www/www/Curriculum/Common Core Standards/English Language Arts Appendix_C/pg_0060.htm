<div style="position:absolute;top:290;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  While culture has a huge impact on the Cordero and Apirana families, the protagonists of both </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:301;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">groups are affected the most. In Esperanza's world, women are put down and locked inside their hus-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:312;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">band's houses, having no rights and absolutely no say in their own households. The patriarchal society </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:323;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">overwhelms every aspect of life, and Esperanza demands change through rebelling in her own quiet </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:355;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">her own path, in the hopes that the oppressed women of Mango Street will realize alternative options. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:366;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Desperately seeking an opportunity to flee Mango Street, Esperanza dreams of the day when she will </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:377;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">leave just another crippled house to seek her own way in the world. However, she states, &quot;They will not </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:398;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3">House on Mango Street). Paikea, on the other hand is a native of New Zealand. According to legend, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:409;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">her ancestor and namesake rode on the back of a whale to this land and her family has been there ever </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:420;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">since. Because of her rich and influential history, Pai is very proud of her culture. She wants the best for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:431;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">her people and she understands that the village and tribe must modernize and change with the times or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">else they may lose everything. For example, in the movie Whale Rider, Pai walks into her kitchen to find </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:452;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">three elder women smoking cigarettes. Hiding the evidence, the conversation dies as soon as she enters </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:463;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the room, but she says to them, &quot;Maori women have got to stop smoking.&quot; Pai loves her culture and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:474;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">significance of the whale, yet she, like Esperanza, demands change, starting with her grandfather Koro </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:485;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">accepting the fact that Pai is destined to become the first female chief of the village. Both girls dream of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:495;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the day where their women will be respected and treated as equals in their patriarchal societies.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:528;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">er like a ribbon on a present. Esperanza, the namesake and great-grandmother of the young protagonist, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:539;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">was a strong-willed woman. &quot;My great-grandmother. I would've liked to have known her, a wild horse of </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:571;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">shoes, she in fact does with her uncle telling her how beautiful she is, making her forget her discomfort </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:582;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and hatred of her shoes. Even though Esperanza may be loved in her family and close community, she is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">of low social status in general. She, like Geraldo in the vignette &quot;Geraldo No Last Name,&quot; is &quot;just another </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:636;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">has never really experienced any luxury other than a used car.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:647;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">  On the other hand, Paikea comes from a broken family. Her mother died during childbirth, along </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:657;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">with her twin brother. After feeling the depression of loss and loneliness, Pai's father Porourangi left </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:668;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">New Zealand to live in Germany, where he sculpted and sold Maori art. Pai was left to be raised by her </span></nobr></div>
