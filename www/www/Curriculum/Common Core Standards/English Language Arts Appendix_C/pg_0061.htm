<div style="position:absolute;top:72;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">example, during the movie, Pai and the young boys of the village attend a school lesson taught by Koro. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Pai is last in line, but sits down on the front bench with the others, although Koro tells her to sit in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">back, the proper place for a woman. She refuses to move even when her grandfather threatens to send </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">her away, which he does because Pai will not give up her seat. As she walks away from the group, Nanny </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Flowers has a proud little smile on her lips, for she knows that Pai is ordained to be the next leader. Be-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cause Pai is next in line to become the chief, she is of very high status, just below the current chief.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">  A prominent figure on Mango Street, Esperanza presents an alternative to the oppression of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">women in the community. In the outside world, however, she is just another young girl with parents who </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">immigrated to the United States in the hopes of a better life for their children. Esperanza wants to set an </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">example for the women trapped in their houses, to provide an escape for those ensnared in the barbed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wire of marriage. Above all, she dreams of the day where she can leave Mango Street, yet she knows that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">it is her duty to return to free her friends. As told by the Three Sisters, &quot;You will always be Esperanza. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">You will always be Mango Street. You can't erase what you know. You can't forget who you are.&quot; These </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">three women told Esperanza that she was special and was meant to be a strong and leading person, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">just like Pai and the whales. Because of the rich diversity and influences in her neighborhood, Esperanza </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:234;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">learns through her friends and experiences they share. Marin, Rafaela, Lucy, Rachel, Sally, and Alicia all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:245;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">provided a learning experience in one way or another. As all of these young ladies are in a similar age </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">range with Esperanza, they undergo multiple trials side-by-side.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">  Contrastingly, Paikea has the blood of a leader running through her veins. She is a native, a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:277;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">leader, and a change. Pai, like Esperanza, is a leading figure amongst the women of her community. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Always aware of the outer world, Pai knows that her people must adapt to the changing times or they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">will be swept away by the current of technology. She holds a great love and respect for her culture and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">people, and she wants what is best for them, even if it involves changing ancient traditions and ways. Pai </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">knows it is her duty to stay, and her desire keeps her rooted in her little village. Once, Pai's father offered </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:331;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to take her to Germany with him to start a new life, and she agreed to go with him. However, in the car </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">ride along the beach, a whale calls from the depths of the ocean and it is then that Pai knows she cannot </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">leave her people. She asks her father to turn around and she returns to the village of her people. Due to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">having little to no interaction with kids her age, Pai must learn from her elders and through Koro's reac-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">tions. The children of the village tease and taunt Pai for her name and her big dreams, yet she pays them </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">no attention. Unlike Esperanza, Pai knew from the beginning that she was destined to be great and is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">different from others her age. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">  Finally, the personalities of these two protagonists are exceedingly different. Esperanza, although </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:418;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">older than Paikea, has low self-esteem and little self-confidence. She is afraid of adults, and as shown in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">&quot;A Rice Sandwich,&quot; she often cries when confronted by her elders. Throughout the novel, Esperanza is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">shamed by her actions, other's actions, and other's words. All this young girl wants is to make friends </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and be loved by others, but she gets in her own way. However, when the world seems against her and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">she is all alone, Esperanza writes to escape. As directed by her deceased Aunt Lupe, she continues the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:472;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">poetry and short stories that free her from the chokehold of Mango Street. While she finds joy in pencils </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:483;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and paper, she does not in her name. &quot;Esperanza&quot; in Spanish means &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;waiting,&quot; two words </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that describe this girl perfectly. She is the hope for the oppressed but she must wait for her opportunity </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:504;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to leave. In contrast to Pai, she actually did have a childhood, a carefree times of playing and having fun </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:515;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">with friends before the burden of responsibility is placed on their shoulders, like the sky on Atlas's.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:526;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">  Paikea, alternatively, is a proud and confident girl. She knows what is best and what her people </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:537;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">must do in order to survive. Starting with the women, she tells them to change their ways at the ripe old </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">age of ten. Pai is a serious and mature child, with a grown mannerism and demeanor. Little can shame </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">her, except for her grandfather; all Pail wants is to be loved and accepted by Koro. While everyone in the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">village can see that Pai is fated to become the next chief, Koro stubbornly refuses to believe until the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:580;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">very end. In her position, she takes her ancestry very seriously. Pai was named after her ancestor who </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:591;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">rode the back of a whale to New Zealand, and she is exceedingly proud of her name, unlike Esperanza. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:601;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">And unlike Esperanza, it seems as though Pai has no time for boys or any relationships between them. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">She considers herself &quot;one of the boys,&quot; and shows no interest. Growing up with her situation and the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">multiple responsibilities that followed left little time for an actual childhood.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">  In the end, the fate of two different cultures rests in the hands of two different young girls. While </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:645;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they both strive for freedom from oppression and change, Esperanza Cordero and Paikea Apirana have </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:655;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">different techniques through which they reach those goals. Esperanza, a quiet and ashamed girl of 13 or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:666;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">14, chooses a singular path to walk. She chooses the road she must walk alone, unaccompanied but free </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:677;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">from patriarchal domination. While fighting to free those sitting at the window, Esperanza finds her own </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:688;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">destiny as the change needed on Mango Street. Paikea, a strong and confident girl of 10 or 11, walks the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:699;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">forbidden path, the path of a chief. She chooses to defy her grandfather and all traditions in order to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:709;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">modernize her people. In order to save them, she must change them. Both young women, influential and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:720;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">inspiring, search for the key to free the ones they love.</span></nobr></div>
