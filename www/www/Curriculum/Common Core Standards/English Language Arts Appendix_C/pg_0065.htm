<div style="position:absolute;top:149;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">The __________ School Board has recently proposed a bond levy to add new facilities as well as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">conduct some major repairs to the school. The bond includes building a new gymnasium, a new science </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">room and lab, a new Media Center/Library, new Chapter 1 and Special Education classrooms, and other </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">facilities such as more parking space, an increase in storage area, and new locker rooms. Along with new </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">construction, the board is proposing to remodel facilities such as the drama/music areas, the entire roof, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the heating system, the school kitchen, and present gym as well. This bond allowing __________ School to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">add more facilities should be passed in order for young students to be provided with a better education.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Several arguments have been brought up concerning the levy since it failed in the March </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:245;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">election. Some say that the school doesn't need to have brand new facilities and better classrooms, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">but it does. Just this year the school had to shut down for days at a time as a result of a malfunction of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the heating system. The roof of the library also had a leaking problem all winter long. The leaking has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">actually caused the ceiling tiles to rot to the point where they are having to be removed. It isn't safe to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">sit underneath them because, in fact, they have fallen to tables where students had been working only </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">minutes before.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:320;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Another issue that people may be concerned with is the money that taxpayers have to put up </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:331;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">for the building. The cost of the project in its entirety will be 2.9 million dollars, meaning that for the next </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">25 years, taxpayers would pay 40 cents more per thousand dollars in property tax than they do this year. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The project does cost a significant amount of money, but the school needs it. If something isn't done now, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">then the facilities such as the library, the science room and others will continue to grow steadily worse. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The construction and remodeling needs to be done eventually, so why not now, when interest rates are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">low and expenses are also low. Superintendent __________ commented that it would cost the taxpayers </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">much less money now than ten years from now. Another reason that this is a good time to pass this bond </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">is that the results of Ballot Measure 5 are going into effect at the same time as the levy. As it stands now, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">property tax rates will go down another $2.50 by next year; however, if taxpayers don't mind paying what </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">they do now and can handle a 40 cent increase, then the school can be that much better.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Many other good reasons we exist for funding this construction now. For one, better facilities </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">will be made available to everyone: staff members, students, and community members. The new gym </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">will allow student athletes to have earlier practices and more time for homework. With only one gym in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a K¨C12 school system, the junior high has to practice in the morning before school, starting at 6:30 A.M., </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:492;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">meaning that both the girls and boys teams had to practice at the same time, with half of the court for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:503;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the girls half for the boys. After school, the high school girls would practice from 3:30 to 5:30 P.M. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">varsity boys would then start at 5:30 or 6:00 and go until 7:30. After that, the junior varsity boys would </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">come in for an hour and a half. It's absurd to think that student athletes can make good use of their time </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">with a schedule like that. If the bond were to pass, both the new gym and the present gym would be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">used for practices and athletes wouldn't have to wait so long to practice every day.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:567;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Another reason that the gym should be built is that it is no longer adequate. The bleachers are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:578;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">too close to the court and so there is no room to walk by without getting in the way during a game. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">gym also poses a problem for the cheerleaders. As it is now, there is no room for them to cheer. They </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">have to stand on one of the ends which, of course, is right in the way of people walking by. If a new gym </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:610;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">were built, enough room would be provided surrounding the court that there wouldn't be any of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:621;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">problems there are now.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Another advantage to the bond proposed is that it would provide more space in the school. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The school has always been small, which is in some ways nice, but it needs to expand. The lack of space </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">is a problem because everyone is crammed into one little hallway trying to make it around from class </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to class. As it is, there isn't enough room for the library to just be a library or the kitchen to just be a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:685;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">kitchen. Students can't even go to the library when they need to because Health, Media, and other </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:696;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">classes are held there. The Satellite Learning classroom, which shares a space with the kitchen, usually </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:707;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">has a difficult learning atmosphere each day people prepare food for the hot lunch program. Another </span></nobr></div>
