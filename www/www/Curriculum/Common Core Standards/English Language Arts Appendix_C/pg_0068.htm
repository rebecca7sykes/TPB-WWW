<div style="position:absolute;top:97;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">This essay was produced for an on-demand assessment. Students were told to write about a character </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">in a work of literature whose pride or selfishness creates problems. The abbreviated time frame of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:118;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the assessment situation (and the consequent lack of opportunity to revise) explains the absence of </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, there is one very particular character whose pride and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">selfishness creates problems. This character had just merely good ideas in the beginning. However, as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">time went on, his true self-interest began to shine through. This character started a free republic of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">animals and turned it into a plantation that used animals as slaves. He never did have enough and always </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">wanted more, regardless of the price that others had to pay. This character whose pride and selfishness </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">creates problems, is none other than the great leader of Animal Farm himself, comrade Napolean </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">[Napoleon], the pig.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Comrade Napolean is a powerful authority on Animal Farm. In fact he is the leader of Animal Farm and a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">high strung leader at that. After Old Major died, Napolean lived upon Old Major's ideas. Napolean lead all </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the animals to rebellion so that Manor Farm ceized to exist, and Animal Farm was born. In the first year, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">he even worked the fields and helped bring in their biggest harvest ever. Little did the animals know, but </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">he would soon change. Eventually the animals started receiving less food because Napolean needed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">more food to power his &quot;large&quot; brain. Later, he goes and runs off his successor, Snowball, so he can have </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the whole farm to himself. Then he stopped working the fields. He started taking young animals and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">selling them or using them for his own use. He stopped sleeping in the hay and slept in the farm house </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">instead. Finally, he took away half the grain fields so he could plant barely to make himself beer. This </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Napolean was a power hungry, selfish individual for sure. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Being power hungry, always causes problems, and boy did Napolean cause problems. The animals </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">had received so little food that many were starving, you could see their bones, and some even died of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">starvation. Nopoleans's lack of work meant the animals had to work harder, and it wasn't easy on an </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">empty stomach. Many animals would break their legs or hoofs but would continue to work. The lack of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">new workers due to Napolean's selling them off, meant that nobody could retire, and one old animal </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">even died in the fields. Snowball was a great teacher for the animals, and now that he was gone, they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">lacked education. Then with finally only half of the fields being productive for food, the animals starved </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">even more and worked harder to make beer that they never saw. Not to mention that they had to sleep </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">on a dirt floor while the lazy Napolean slept in his nice comfortable bed. His selfishness had deffinately </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">created problems.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:492;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Napolean's experience had changed the farm drastically. He thought things were getting better while the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:503;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">animals knew they were only getting worse. After the rebellion, many humans disliked Animal Farm and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the animals disliked humans. Nopoleans's selfish ways were much like those of a farmer. So eventually as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Napolean became more &quot;human,&quot; the town's people began to like him. Napolean could care less about </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his animals, just so long as he was on good terms with the humans. By the novel's end, Napolean is great </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">friends with every human in town. However, his animal slaves are no longer happy as they once were. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">They still hate humans which means now, they hate Napolean. So due to Napolean's pride, the story has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">changed its ways from start to finish. He has turned friends into foe and foe into friends, but at great </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">cost.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, Comrade Napolean is a character whose pride and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:610;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">selfishness creates problems. The starving animals have suffered greatly because of their leader's pride. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:621;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">On the other hand, Napolean has gained great success through his selfishness. Unfortunately, that's just </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:632;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the way it is. You can't have pride without problems. Even if they are little problems, it's still due to pride. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:643;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now, if Napolean had pride in his farm rather than in himself, well then maybe the humans would've </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">hated him, but he'd still has his true friends of four legs. However, he chose to follow a different path </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:664;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and he burned those bridges along the way. So for now, Comrade Napolean's pride and selfishness has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:675;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">created problems for the animals, but someday, it will create problems for himself.</span></nobr></div>
