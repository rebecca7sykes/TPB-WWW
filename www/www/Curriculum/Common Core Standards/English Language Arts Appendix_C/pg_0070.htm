<div style="position:absolute;top:107;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Acceptance. Wright struggles to find his 'place' in society. He refuses to forgo his morality and beliefs </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:118;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to conform to the status quo. Examine Wright's pride. Find examples in the text that demonstrate the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:129;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">influence pride has on Wright's actions. How does his pride influence his decisions? Is pride a positive or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">negative influence in Wright's life? How does Wright's pride affect how his family members treat him?&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Students had one week to complete this assignment. The maximum length allowed was three pages. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:247"><nobr><span class="ft3">Marching to His Own Beat</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Pride is often criticized by society and habitually seen as a negative characteristic evoking </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">such connotations as conceit, egotism, arrogance, and hubris. In Richard Wright's struggle to find his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">&quot;place&quot; in society in Black Boy, pride has both negative and positive connotations. Despite the negative </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">consequences, pride allows Wright to maintain his moral compass, oppose conformity, and pursue his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">passion of writing, thus demonstrating pride's positive influence on Wright's life.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Wright's pride prompts him to make principled decisions and carry out actions that illustrate his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">morality and inherent beliefs. Wright refuses to neglect his values and chooses right over wrong even </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">when he recognizes that failure to adhere to what is expected of him will ultimately result in negative </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and often violent consequences. When he receives the title of valedictorian and refuses to read the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">speech prepared for him by his principal, choosing instead to present his own speech in spite of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">threat of being held back, Wright's pride is demonstrated. Although he comprehends the consequences </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and the gravity of his decision, Wright refuses to compromise his beliefs: &quot;I know that I'm not educated, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">professor . . . But the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">written&quot; (174). Though urged by his family members and his classmates to avoid conflict and to comply </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">with the principal's demand, Wright refuses because he does not believe it is the morally correct thing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to do. Even though his pride is negatively perceived by his peers and relatives as the source of defiance, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">they fail to realize that his pride is a positive factor that gives him the self confidence to believe in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:386;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">himself and his decisions. Wright's refusal to acquiesce to his family's ardent religious values is another </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:397;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">illustration of his pride. Wright is urged by his family and friends to believe in God and partake in their </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">daily religious routines; however, he is undecided about his belief in God and refuses to participate in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:418;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">practicing his family's religion because &quot;[His] faith, such as it was, was welded to the common realities </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:429;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">of life, anchored in the sensations of [his] body and what [his] mind could grasp, and nothing could ever </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">shake this faith, and surely not [his] fear of an invisible power&quot; (115). He cannot put his confidence into </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:451;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">something unseen and remains unwavering in his belief. Pride allows Wright to flee from the oppressive </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">boundaries of expectations and to escape to the literary world.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:482;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Wright's thirst and desire to learn is prompted by his pride and allows him to excel in school </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and pursue his dreams of becoming a writer. The reader observes Wright's pride in his writing when </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:504;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">he wrote his first story. Pleased with his work, he &quot;decided to read it to a young woman who lived next </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:515;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">door . . . [He] looked at her in a cocky manner that said: . . . I write stuff like this all the time. It's easy&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">(120-121). This attitude of satisfaction permits Wright to continue to push himself to improve and pursue </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his craft. Pride eventually leads Wright to submit his work to the local newspaper; his obvious pride in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:547;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">his work is clearly portrayed when he impatiently tells the newspaper editor, &quot;But I want you to read it </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">now&quot; (165) and asks for his composition book back when he does not immediately show interest in his </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:569;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">story. Pride in his academic achievements motivates him to excel in his studies; after Wright advanced to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">sixth grade in two weeks, he was elated and thrilled at his astonishing accomplishment: &quot;Overjoyed, I ran </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:590;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">home and babbled the news . . . I had leaped a grade in two weeks, anything seemed possible, simple, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:601;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">easy&quot; (125). Wright's pride in his intelligence and studies allows him to breeze through school: &quot;I burned </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:612;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">at my studies . . . I read my civics and English and geography volumes through and only referred to them </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">in class. I solved all my mathematical problems far in advance&quot; (133). Pride provides him with the self-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">confidence and contentment that his family and society fail to give him. It removes Wright from both </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:644;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the black culture and the white culture and moves him rather to the &quot;art culture&quot;, in which Wright can </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:655;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">achieve higher than what is anticipated of him.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:676;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft2">Wright's ability to oppose conformity and forego the status quo also stems from his pride. Pride </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:687;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">propels him to assert himself even if it defies what is expected of him as a black individual. Upon telling </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">one of his old employers, a white woman, that he wants to be a writer, she indecorously scoffs at him </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:708;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and makes an impudent remark &quot;You'll never be a writer . . . Who on earth put such ideas into your . . . </span></nobr></div>
