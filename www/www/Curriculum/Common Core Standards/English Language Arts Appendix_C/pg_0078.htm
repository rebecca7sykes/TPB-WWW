<div style="position:absolute;top:97;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">This essay was produced in a two-hour-long college placement exam. Students first read a passage of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">approximately a thousand words titled &quot;In Praise of Boredom.&quot; The passage was adapted from an essay </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:118;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">published by Ellen Ruppel Shell in 2000. Students were then asked to respond to Shell's views, drawing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:129;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">on anything else they had previously read, their observations, and/or their experiences. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:249"><nobr><span class="ft3">Freedom From Structure</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Children are blank slates that are subject to the environment around them. Allowing a child to interact </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">with their surroundings is difficult for adults because it leaves each decision, and each consequence </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">of that decision, up to them. Ellen Ruppel Shell believes that children miss out on experimenting and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">discovering aspects of the world that cannot be taught in a classroom or read about in a book. I agree </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">that children can learn many important lessons about social interaction and the products of creativity by </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">playing on their own, or with other children, in a free and open environment.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:245;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">To relieve the inevitable boredom that every child eventually encounters, they can nourish their creative </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">minds by playing alone. As a child, I was content to sometimes play by myself in a land of make-believe. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">If it was cold and rainy outside, I would pretend it was the middle of summer. Night became day, my </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">bedroom became a kingdom, my bed was a castle, my floor was a mote, and I was a princess. Playing </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">&quot;let's pretend&quot; allowed me to imagine and create my own world when reality seemed too mundane. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">&quot;Boredom leads to exploration, which leads to creativity,&quot; and nothing is more creative than a world that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">exists in the mind of a child. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:331;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">There are endless opportunities for parents to stimulate and teach their kids that come with instructions </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:342;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and rules and boundaries, but I agree with Shell when she declares that &quot;the best play is spontaneous </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and unpredictable.&quot; Plain and simple freedom is invaluable, and we are only so free as children. As we </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">grow up, our minds become molded around society's rules and we learn to conform to a certain way of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">thinking and creating. If adults see a soccer ball, they will only think of how to play soccer. If children see </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a soccer ball they will immediately create their own rules and proceed with an entirely different game. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The ability to be spontaneous and imaginative is strongest in children because they know nothing else. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:407;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Adults and parents that bombard their kids with structured activities are wasting the unique and innate </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ability of children to create; however, a parent's reasoning for such structure is not unsupported.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">There are many life lessons that can be difficult to learn on your own, so adults establish controlled </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">environments for their children to learn about the world. For example, making new friends can be an </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">awkward and terrifying process for kids, so parents will try to make friends for their children. What most </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">adults don't realize is that they are robbing their child of a chance to open up and reach out to another </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">person. The kid they meet on the jungle gym will be more beneficial to them than the kid their parent </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:492;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">forced them to play with. &quot;We don't believe that they can navigate the world, so we try to navigate it for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:503;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">them.&quot; Shell believes that adults need to trust their kids to discover the world for themselves and that it's </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">just as important for them to fail as it is for them to succeed.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">For children, it's not about the final product, it's how they get there. When forced to follow rules and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:545;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">obey boundaries, kids are not given the opportunity to use their imagination. I agree with Shell and I </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">believe that it is more beneficial for children to make believe, be spontaneous, and discover as much as </span></nobr></div>
