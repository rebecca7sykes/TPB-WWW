<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">today's wide array of perceptions, ideas, and values. Issues that could never have been foreseen are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">often identified and made known today because of technology. Once, there were scatterings of people </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">who had the same idea, yet never took any action because none knew of the others; now, given our </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">new and arguable idea surfaces, the debate spreads across the global community like wildfire. Topics </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">that the general public might never have become aware of are instantly made into news that can be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">discussed at the evening dinner table. One such matter, which has sparked the curiosity of millions, is the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:246;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">recent interest in the classification of literature as fiction or nonfiction.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">A number of questions have arisen: What sparked the booming interest? Where exactly is the line that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">separates fiction from nonfiction, and how far can the line be stretched until one becomes the other? Are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">there intermediaries between the two, or must we classify each piece of literature as one or the other? </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Do authors do this purposefully, or with no intent? The answers to these questions are often circular and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">simply lead to further dispute. In modern times, the line between the classification of literature as either </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">fiction or nonfiction has become blurred and unclear; the outdated definitions and qualifications have </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">sparked the development of new genres and challenged the world's idea on the differences between the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">two.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:384;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Though it had been a fairly relevant and known topic to members of the literary world, the idea that a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:395;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">book is not always completely fiction or nonfiction seemed to be an obscure and unnecessary subject </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:406;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">for the public to ponder. However, the average Monday morning watercooler conversation was forever </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">changed when what has become known as the &quot;Million Little Lies Scandal&quot; broke out in early 2006. It </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:427;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">started on October 26, 2005 when author James Frey appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He was the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:438;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">only guest of the day, there to promote and discuss his book entitled A Million Little Pieces. The book, a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:449;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">nonfiction memoir, recounts Frey's experience as an alcoholic, drug addict, and criminal, and the heroic </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">story of his overcoming of every obstacle in his path to getting clean. After his appearance on the show </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">and addition into Oprah's highly esteemed and publicized book club, the novel skyrocketed to the top of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:481;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the charts, eventually becoming a number one best seller. But his success was short lived; in the months </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:492;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">that followed, The Smoking Gun, a Web site that posts legal documents, arrest records, and investigates </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:503;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">celebrity police dealings, unearthed some discrepancies between Frey's story and the police documents </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:514;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">that should have supported his claims.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Though the Web site had originally only been searching for Frey's mugshot, one small inconsistency </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:545;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">soon led to another, and after a six-week investigation, the site released its findings. Investigators had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:556;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">taken any parts of Frey's story that could be verified by a police record, matched it with his actual </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:567;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">records, and were shocked by what they found; nearly all of Frey's memoir was either highly embellished </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:578;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">or flat out fabricated. Huge discrepancies between the truth and what was stated in Frey's book became </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">headline news; instances like Frey claiming to be in jail for eighty-seven days when in reality he was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">incarcerated for a mere four hours, or the serious drug charges that he claimed were filed against him </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:610;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">that were never found on any record.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Frey was caught, and on January 8, 2006, The Smoking Gun published an article called &quot;A Million Little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Lies,&quot; which took an in-depth look at every provable inconsistency in the novel. By comparing direct </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">quotes from the book to police records¡ªor rather, the lack of police records¡ªFrey's entire novel was </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">pieced apart until there was nothing remaining. Completely discredited, yet still somehow maintaining </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">the entire situation was a misunderstanding, Frey attempted to salvage his namesake by reappearing on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:685;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Oprah; in the end, this proved to be more damaging than helpful. He had his reasons for what he'd done, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:696;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">he tried to explain.</span></nobr></div>
