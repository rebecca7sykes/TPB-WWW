<div style="position:absolute;top:125;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Regardless, in the end, it was proved beyond anyone's reasonable doubt that James Frey's novel landed </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:136;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dead center in the proverbial grey area between black and white¡ªhis novel was partially fiction and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">partially nonfiction. And so started the media frenzy; the scandal covered newsstands for weeks, people </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">took sides with either Frey or his critics, and similarly themed novels were called into question. Suddenly </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the world cared about a novel's validity; they no longer assumed that the words fiction and nonfiction </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">could themselves define the amount of fact that stood behind a piece of literature. People also realized, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">simultaneously, that they might not exactly know what defined and separated fiction and nonfiction, or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">if, in more modern times, the two might mesh together a bit more than in the literature of old.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222;left:234"><nobr><span class="ft2">With Difficulty, the Line is Drawn</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:243;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Fiction and nonfiction: they're two words that are surprisingly hard to define. It's difficult to ascertain </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:253;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">what the words have meant in the past, what they each encompass today, and how past and present </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:264;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">definitions have been molded and shaped by the literature of the time. Traditionally, fiction is 'a tale </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">drawn from the imagination' and nonfiction is 'a statement of fact'; however, the two are so much more </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:286;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">complex than that. For many, the word 'fiction' is associable with the word 'story,' as if the two are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:297;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">equal or interchangeable. Subgenres of fiction often contribute to this perception; novels, short stories, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fairy tales, comics, films, animation, and even video games help the mind classify fiction as a substance </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:318;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">completely fabricated in the mind. Fiction is largely assumed to be a form of art or entertainment, and in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:329;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">many cases this is true¡ªscience fiction and romance novels are two examples of how we are entertained </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:340;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">by a good book. But frequently, stories are told to educate¡ªto raise awareness regarding a certain topic </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:351;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about which the author is concerned.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Stories like Cormac McCarthy's The Road, George Orwell's 1984, and Ayn Rand's Anthem all warn us </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about terrible futures that may arise as the result of the choices of humanity. Uzodinma Iweala's Beasts </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">of No Nation is a short work of fiction based entirely around fact; while it tells the tale of a fictional little </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:404;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">African boy thrown into a bloody civil uprising, his story of being a recruited child soldier is happening </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:415;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to hundreds of similar boys to this very day. Fables and parables are other, more subliminal examples of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:425;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">educational, moral-based fiction.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:446;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">In the same way, nonfiction is surrounded by many presumptions; people assume that anything read </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:457;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in a nonfiction book is true, otherwise the literature would be labeled as fiction. Nonfiction literature </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:468;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">is factual literature, but there is one important note to make. Nonfiction is literature that is presented </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as fact. This presentation may be accurate or inaccurate; in other words, the author is presumed to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:489;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">be writing what he or she believes to be the truth, or what he or she has been led to believe is the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:500;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">truth. Examples of nonfiction include essays, documentaries, scientific papers, textbooks, and journals. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Nonfiction differs from fiction, however, in the areas regarding how the literature is presented and used. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:522;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Directness, simplicity, and clarity are all aims of nonfiction literature.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:543;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Providing straight, accessible, understandable information to the reader is the purpose of nonfiction, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:553;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the ability to communicate well to the audience is what defines a skilled writer of the field. And despite </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:564;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the truth behind nonfiction writing, it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:575;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">being presented; therefore, a balanced, coherent and informed argument is also vital.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:596;left:232"><nobr><span class="ft2">More Than Simply Black or White</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The line between fiction and nonfiction starts to blur, however, when one considers genres that seem to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:627;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">mesh the two; historical fiction, new journalism, and biographies/autobiographies. These are only three </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:638;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of the defined new genres encompassed by what has become the intermediary between fiction and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:649;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">nonfiction¡ª literary nonfiction. When one explores these three genres, it becomes blaringly obvious how </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:660;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">easily fiction and nonfiction can blur into one.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:681;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Historical fiction is the product when an author takes real people and real events and tells the story </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:691;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of what actually happened to them, but inserts characters of their own creation and a plot line that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:702;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">they invent in order to tie the entire novel together. This idea is perfectly exampled in Ann Rinaldi's </span></nobr></div>
