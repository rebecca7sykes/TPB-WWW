<div style="position:absolute;top:115;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">some level, this novel is nonfiction. Yet it is also blatantly fiction！it has characters.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:136;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">New journalism, biographies, and autobiographies, however, blur the lines in a slightly different way; they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">call into question people's ability to relay information truthfully and with no bias. New journalism is the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">term coined in the 1960s to describe the then unconventional journalism techniques that brought the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">reader inside the life and mind of the story. It's a practice very common today; just watch any network </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">investigation series. The journalist attempts to get inside the mind of whomever is being investigated; he </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">or she digs up information regarding that person's past, present, and potential future. The author then </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">takes all the factual background information they've collected and pairs it with the emotions, memories, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and feelings described to them by the person, and writes the complete story. If the complete work is to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">be published as a book rather than a news article or made into a television script, it often ends up being </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:233;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">sold as a fiction novel. Yet is this the correct classification, given that all the information is true?</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:254;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">One excellent example of new journalism is Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. When asked about it, Capote </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">himself even called it &quot;unclassifiable.&quot; Capote traveled to Kansas to investigate the murder of a family of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">four; he ended up staying there for years, befriending the people of the town, discovering what he could </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:287;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about the murders from them, and piecing together his book from interviews and information he gained </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:297;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">during his stay. When it was published, the novel became a best seller and also one of the first highly </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:308;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">noted pieces of literature to border the line between fiction and nonfiction; it was the first of its kind to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:319;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">bring the idea of the blurring line to households across the United States.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:340;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Biographies and autobiographies are often questioned in the same way. Though not always thought of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:351;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as controversial and previously considered nonfiction, biographies and autobiographies don't appear to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fit into today's definition of fiction or nonfiction. The authors of both are simply telling the story of their </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">own life or of someone else's life, but that begs an obvious question; is a highly detailed, written record </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of a person's feelings and perceptions able to be considered nonfiction? How can we classify people's </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">emotions and memories as fact? An outstanding example of an autobiographical piece that cannot be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:405;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">defined is Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried. His self-proclaimed 'nonfiction novel' is a collection </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:415;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of stories stemming from both his imagination and his personal experience in Vietnam during the war. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:426;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">O'Brien feels that the idea of creating a story that is technically false yet truthfully portrays a situation！</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:437;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">as opposed to just stating the facts and stirring no emotion within the reader！is the correct way to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:448;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">educate the public in a meaningful, everlasting way. He, like many others, believes that biographies and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:459;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">autobiographies should be left as their own separate being; a genre where the reader may classify for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">himself or herself what truth and what fiction might lie within the literature. All of the issues mentioned </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:480;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">above are shrouded in debate; there are no straightforward answers.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:501;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Fiction and nonfiction are two polar opposites on a scale that today offers little to no gradient. In years </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:512;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">past, these two words have been definition enough and have managed to encompass all types of written </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:523;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">word. Times change, however, and in the modern day, authors have begun to push the boundaries and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:533;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">discover the furthest extent of where literature can take us. Since they feel as if their literature does not </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:544;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">fit into the classifications of fiction or nonfiction, authors are creating new genres where their novels and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">books can be properly sorted and defined. An update is long overdue！both an update to the definitions </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">currently used to classify books, and an update in which we create new areas into which books can be </span></nobr></div>
