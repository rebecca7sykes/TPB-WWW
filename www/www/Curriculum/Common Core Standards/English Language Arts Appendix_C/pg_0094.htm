<div style="position:absolute;top:107;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">placement in a college composition course sequence. The student had unlimited time to write and likely </span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:160;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The violin is arguably the most cherished and well-known orchestral instrument in the world. Many are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">moved by its unique quality of sound; it is known as the only instrument close to the sound of a human </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:181;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">voice. Maybe the violin is so revered because &quot;humans in all times and places are powerfully moved, or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">threatened, by the possibility that with our hands and minds we can create something that is perfect&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">(Ebert). But the sound of this instrument was not magically created overnight; the creation of the very </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">first violin took many years and has been a product of much experimentation. This is the reason that </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:225;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">every beginning violinist should learn to appreciate the art of making a violin and the process of holding </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:235;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and bowing his instrument so that he will have the knowledge to play it well.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:256;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The process of constructing a violin is an age-old tradition that has been developed and refined for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">centuries. Each step is crucial to the quality of the instrument's sound. The violin's body consists of a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:278;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">rib structure, which is made from six thin maple ribs that are bent to shape by applying dry heat. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ribs are reinforced at the joints by wood blocks that are located in each of the four outward curving </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:299;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">corners, one at the top rib, and one at the lower rib. To reinforce the glue-joints between the ribs and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:310;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the table and back of the violin, strips of willow or pine are glued along the inside edges of the ribs to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">create the lining. The back plate of the violin is made from either one or two matched pieces of maple. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:332;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The wood chosen for these pieces is very important and affects the sound production of the violin. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:343;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">outline of the plate is drawn onto the maple and sawn out, and the arching (the outward bulge) is then </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:353;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">painstakingly carved to a thickness of about five millimeters. The front plate of the violin, or table, has </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:364;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">two soundholes carved from it on either side of the bridge. These soundholes are [shaped like the letter </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">f] and are made to project the sound. Purfling is done by inlaying thin strips of wood around the top </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:386;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">and back of the violin a short distance from the rim. Purfling strengthens the delicate edgework and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:397;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">produces a beautiful frame around the instrument's outline (Gusset). </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:417;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">The bridge is cut from a thin sliver of maple. Intricate shapes are carved from it, known as the &quot;heart,&quot; </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">&quot;ears,&quot; and the two &quot;feet&quot; that allow it to stand on the violin table. The bridge is placed directly between </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:439;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the small nicks cut in the middle of each [soundhole]. The top of the bridge is curved to conform to the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">arch of the violin table, which allows the player to play each string individually (Skinner). The bridge is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:461;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">held onto the instrument by as much as seventeen pounds of pressure exerted from the four strings, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">which makes it a very delicate piece that must be checked periodically for leaning or warping. A bass-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:482;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">bar is fitted to the underside of the table underneath the left foot of the bridge. Underneath the right </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">foot of the bridge, a soundpost is wedged between the front and back panel. The soundpost is made of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:504;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">spruce or pine and resists the downward pressure of the strings and improves the sound.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:525;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">A neck is fitted to the top rib and is made to hold the fingerboard above the table. The fingerboard is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">a piece of ebony that extends beyond the neck and gradually widens towards the bridge. At the top of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:546;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">the neck is a pegbox that has holes drilled into each side in which the pegs are held. The pegs are used </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:557;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">for a wide range of tuning. The pegbox slopes slightly backwards, which tensions the strings across the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">ebony nut at the top of the fingerboard and keeps them raised above the fingerboard. At the top of the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:579;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">pegbox is a scroll, added during the baroque period as an artistic flourish to provide an aesthetic touch </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">to its already pleasing appearance (Vienna Online Magazine). The strings are wrapped around the pegs, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:600;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">stretched across the bridge, and held by an ebony or boxwood tailpiece. Anywhere from one to four fine </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:611;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">tuners can be attached to the tailpiece; these are used to tighten or loosen the string to change its pitch </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:622;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">for fine-tuning. The tailpiece is held into place by a loop of gut or nylon that is wrapped around an ebony </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">end button located in the middle of the bottom rib.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">After gluing is done, the violin must be exposed to air and sun for several days to a few weeks to darken </span></nobr></div>
