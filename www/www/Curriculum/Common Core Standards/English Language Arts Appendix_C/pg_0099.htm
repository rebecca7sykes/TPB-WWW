<div style="position:absolute;top:18;left:29"><nobr><span class="ft0">Common Core State StandardS for engliSh language artS  &amp; literaCy in hiStory/SoCial StudieS, SCienCe, and teChniCal SubjeCtS</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">strengthen up corners. The pieces can also be doweled together, which is one of the stronger ways to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">attach the two pieces. The two pieces can also be biscuit jointed together which is another fairly strong </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">way to attach them.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Another fairly simple joint is the lap joint. The lap joint is where the two pieces of wood to be joined are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cut so only half the thickness of each piece is left. They are then glued, nailed, or screwed together. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:136;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">lap joint is mostly used for frames that will have plywood on them. The joint is also used in latticework, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">which is used for decoration in different pieces of furniture. The downside to this joint is that it isn't very </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">strong but it does look nice in some applications.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The next joint is a little more complicated but still fairly simple. The only thing complicated about the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">miter joint is figuring out the angles for different shapes. A square is simple but you have to make sure </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the saw is exactly square or the joints won't fit tight. But as you get into different sided shapes the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">angles are harder to figure out, especially if they have to be a compound miter. That is where it is cut on </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">an angle in two different directions. The miter joint looks good because there is no end grain but it isn't </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:233;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">very strong. But biscuits can be added for some extra strength.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:253;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The next joint is the dado joint. Dados are slots cut across the grain. They are cut using a dado blade in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:264;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the table saw, on a router, or hand chiseled. The uses of a dado are for putting shelves in the sideboards </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of a bookcase or other piece of furniture. The dado can be stopped short of the edge of the board to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:286;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">form a stopped dado. This is useful when you don't want the joint to be seen.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A joint similar to the dado is a groove. A groove runs with the grain instead of against it. There are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">several ways to cut a groove. You can use a dado blade, router, molder, or shaper. A groove is usually </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:328;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">used in making raised panels. It is what holds the pane in between the rails and stiles.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:349;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A joint similar to a groove is the spline. The spline joint can either be a solid spline like tongue and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:360;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">groove. That is where one board has a groove and another one has a piece with both edges are cut off </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">leaving the middle. A loose spline is a board with two grooves cut and then apiece of wood inserted in </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:381;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the tow grooves and glued. The uses good for the spline is siding and paneling. It also works fairly well </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:392;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">in making large panels because the tongue helps to keep the boards aligned. You can dress up the spline </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:403;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">joint by putting a chamfer or bead on the edge of the boards.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:424;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A good joint for joining backs to furniture is the rebate joint. It also works well for joining the tops and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:435;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">bottoms of furniture. A rebate joint is a dado at the end or edge of a board and usually has a piece of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:445;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">wood in it the same thickness as the dado. The wood is usually nailed or screwed into place. Another </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:456;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">version of the rebate joint is one that is stopped. The stopped rebates are used when you don't want the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:467;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">joint to show.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:488;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">A joint that can be quite complicated is the scarf joint. The scarf joint is used to make two boards into a </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:499;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">a longer one. This joint is mostly used in timber frames. The joint came around in Europe when they had </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:509;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cut all the long big trees down and had to find a way to make the long beams needed for their buildings </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:520;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">(Ramuz, 279). Then when the settlers came to America, they didn't need it for another hundred years or </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:531;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">so until they did the same thing over here. The joint is usually about eight times longer than the width of </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:542;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">the board or beam. It is made to have a lot of glue surface to make it a fairly strong joint. But it is not as </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:553;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">strong as a full-length board or beam.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Another joint that can be quite complicated until you have the jig made for it is the finger joint. The </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:584;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">finger joint is easy once the jig is made you just have to stand at the table saw and keep running the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">boards over the dado bade. The finger joint is several grooves on the end of a board with the other </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:606;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">board cut to mate. They are very strong because it really increases the glue surface. The joint can also be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">used as a hinge if the corners are rounded and a dowel put all the way through the joint.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:637;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The last two joints left are some of the most complicated ones to design and cut. These joints are the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:648;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">real give away of quality joinery. If these joints are done properly they can last for hundreds of years and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:659;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">will really make your work look professional. The two joints are the mortise and tenon and dovetails. You </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:670;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">can either cut these by hand or machine. If cut by machine, they aren't as complicated to make as they </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:681;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">are when you cut them by hand. The joints aren't cut by hand as much anymore, but when they are you </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:691;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">can take more pride in your work.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:712;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">I will start with the mortise and tenon. The mortise and tenon has been around for hundreds and hundreds </span></nobr></div>
