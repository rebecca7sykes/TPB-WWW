<div style="position:absolute;top:72;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of years. There are many uses including timber frame, attaching aprons to the legs on tables, and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">attaching rails and stiles on doorframes. Mortise and tenon are very strong joints. The timber frame barns </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and buildings are still standing after hundreds of years. The only reason they fall is because of decay and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">neglect. The mortise is a square hold cut to a certain depth and size. A through mortise is a square hole </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">that is cut all the way through the board or beam. The tenon is the mate to a mortise.  It is a square cut </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">on the end of a board or beam. They are usually in the center of the board but can be offset if there is </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">going to be more than one joint in the same spot. It also could be offset if it was going to be close to the </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">edge of the other post or leg. A through tenon can look good with a wedge, or you can peg the tenon for </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">strength. Mortises can be cut with a mortise, router, or drilled out and squared up with a chisel. Tenons </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">can be cut by router, table saw, or by hand. But whatever way you do it they still mean good quality </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">work.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The other hallmark of quality wood joinery is the dovetail. Dovetails can either be cut by a router and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">template or by hand with a lot of practice. A dovetail is similar to a finger joint except that it has angles. </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">The dovetail has been around for thousands of years and there is a reason why. It is very aesthetically </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:233;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">pleasing and strong enough to last for a very long time. Dovetails are very strong because it is made to </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:244;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">pull apart in only one direction so from any other direction it can handle extreme loads.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:265;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Now to make dovetails by hand you need to take your time and be patient. They aren't as hard as you </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:276;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">may think but does take practice. When the joint is completely cut it should fit together with a light push </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:287;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and should be very stiff. Dovetails are used in making drawer frames and the main box in cabinets. There </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:297;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">are two types of dovetails and they are through dovetails and half-blind dovetails. Through dovetails </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:308;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">are the ones where both boards go all the way through each other leaving the joint exposed. Half-blind </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:319;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">dovetails are usually used to attach drawer fronts to the rest of the frame. On those, only half of the joint </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:330;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">is visible because the other half ends short by 1/8 inch or more.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:351;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Now that you know the basics, here are a few more things you should know to make strong dovetails. If </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:361;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">creating dovetails out of softwood, you should have a slope of 1 to 6 on the dovetails. If making them out </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:372;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">of hardwood, the angle should be 1 to 8 (AM-wood.com). The reason for this is because softwood splits </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:383;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">easier, this way the dovetail won't spread the wood as much when pulled on.  If you are making multiple </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:394;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">joints it is better to make a pattern so they are all the same. Plus it won't take as long because you won't </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:405;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">have to lay them out every time. Dovetails are made up of two parts and they are pins and tails. It doesn't </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:415;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">matter which ones you choose to cut first but you should always trace its mate to get a perfect fit.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:436;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">That is all twelve woodworking joints. Now lets talk about beefing them up a little. Sure there are nails, </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:447;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">screws, and other mechanical fasteners, but I'm talking about shop made ones. Dowels and biscuits are </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:458;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">excellent ways to strengthen joints unnoticeably. But wedges, pegs, and wooden blocks are good ways </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:469;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and could even add some decoration. On through tenons, you can cut slots in the end of the tenon and </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">add some wedges as a design and a way to keep it from pulling out. On mortise and tenons you can drill </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:490;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">a hole and insert a peg for strength and looks.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">To sum it all up there is a lot of information on the twelve different wood joints. Some of them can be </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:522;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">quite complicated but with practice you could become an amateur woodworker. I have learned a lot </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:533;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">about the different joints and techniques behind them. This research helped a lot in deciding what joints </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:543;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">to use and how to construct them for my tech project. My tech project is designing and building a gun </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">cabinet. In my gun cabinet I'm going to use rebates, grooves, dados, lock miters, dovetails, mortise </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:565;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">and tenon and lap joints. I hope you have learned as much as I have about choosing and creating </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">joints in wood. There is still more to be learned but this is a very good start in becoming a professional </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:587;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">woodworker. </span></nobr></div>
