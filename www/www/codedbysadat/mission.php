          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p><b> Teacherplanbook, Made by Teachers, for Teachers!</b></p>

<p align="center">Today's  teacher is on the cutting edge of technology utilizing it throughout  their teaching dynamic. Why then are we teachers forced to compile  our plan into a completely blank plan book using antiquated utensils? "No Teacher Left Behind!"</p>
<p align="center">TeacherPlanbook.com  was created to provide immediate access to National Core Standards  and state specific curriculum, while also eliminating the redundancy  of filling out the antiquated plan book by hand. We improved it with  today's technology creating a virtual plan book that parallels what  we already do <strong>and</strong> gives opportunity to do what we always wished. Teachers finally have  a vehicle that links the National Core Standards as well as state  curriculum to their plan book which is exponentially faster! Simply  go to the objective page and click on links to a variety of National  and state curriculums and standards, highlight what you would like  in your objectives and paste it to your plan book. Edit it as you  like. It's that easy! </p>
<p align="center">Even more  easy is the registration process which asks you the start date of the  new academic year and automatically populates your plan book! And  more exciting still is the renewal process for future years which  asks if you care to automatically adjust the dates of your plan book  for the new academic year! No longer do you need to rewrite your plan  each year. Just choose the auto-populate option and edit as needed. </p>
<p align="center">TeacherPlanBook.com  is also innovative in its ability to collaborate! For each lesson  objective completed, members can choose to share their plan and have  it automatically stored in our TeacherPlanBook.com library. Our  library incorporates a search vehicle so if you are working on a  topic, simply type that topic into the search box and  TeacherPlanBook.com will search our library for what other members  have written on that topic. All you have to do is choose something  that you like and copy it into your objectives. You can edit and  personalize it at your discretion. No need to reinvent the wheel!</p>
<p align="center">TeacherPlanBook.com  also has expanded features such as guest viewer where by a teacher  can simply give their member number out to administrators,  substitutes or parents for them to view the day by day lesson  objectives and assignments. No longer will there be excuses or people  chasing you around to view your plan book. And TeacherPlanBook.com  puts it all at your finger tips to populate your plan book virtually  with a touch of a button. </p>
<p align="center">Teaching time  is always at a premium. Creativity sets our lessons to life.  TeacherPlanbook.com was created to give us the freedom to maximize  our time, the immediate access to needed information to fine tune our  plan, so ultimately we can be as creative as our own imaginations  allow, with accuracy and new found ways of utilizing a teachers plan  book to afford students opportunity to become better learners.</p>
