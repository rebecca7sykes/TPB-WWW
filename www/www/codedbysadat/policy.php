We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by TeacherPlanBook, Inc. at www.TeacherPlanBook.com (www.TeacherPlanBook.com Network includes all Web sites and certain other Internet media properties hyper linked from the TeacherPlanBook.com home page.) The following discloses our Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong><br />
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's 
"Internet Protocol" IP Address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the TeacherPlanBook.com Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the TeacherPlanBook.com Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also <strong>Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?</strong> 
We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. 
Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What are cookies?</strong><br>
From time to time, TeacherPlanBook.com or its advertisers may send a "cookie" 
to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your 
Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created 
by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which 
areas of the TeacherPlanBook.com Network you have visited or customized, so the next time 
you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. You can choose whether to accept cookies
 by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all
 cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not
 to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished
 and some features may not work as intended.

TeacherPlanBook.com may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. TeacherPlanBook.com does not gather personal information through the use of these images.

<strong>What information do you collect when I register for something?</strong><Br>
TeacherPlanBook.com offers access to some services that require registration. We may use your registration contact information to send notification to you of 
TeacherPlanBook.com products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our clients. Our clients may
 send you promotional material that is related to the topic of the service for which you registered. We may also use your IP address internally 
and share it with third parties. See <strong>Will you disclose the information that you collect to outside third parties </strong>

<br>
<strong>
What other information do you request?
</strong><Br>
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about conferences and trade shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

<br />
<br />
<strong>What information do you collect when I purchase something?</strong><Br>
If you are purchasing something from at TeacherPlanBook.com , we and any third party provider, need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without your express permission.
Certain TeacherPlanBook.com media properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other TeacherPlanBook.com media properties may not use SSL and thereby would not offer a secure coded way to transfer information.
Wherever TeacherPlanBook.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
