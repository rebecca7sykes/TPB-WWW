"After fifteen plus years of utilizing lesson plans and fifteen plus years of supervising teacher use of lesson plans, <br>
I believe TeacherPlanBook, a computerized system, will save a great deal of time and effort for both teachers and supervisors,<br> 
enabling the focus of time and attention to be on the students and their learning styles.  Use it wisely, to your advantage and to that of your students." <br>

Thank you for Teacherplanbook.com! After several years of searching, trying numerous "free" programs and paying for many plan book programs and apps for my iPad
your plan book is the very first that I found to be simple to learn, easy to use, and which fulfills all of my planning and reporting needs! I especially love that
it is internet based (one less thing to carry), that I can tie assignments to texts and materials that I commonly use (saving time and typing), and that I can link
lessons to State Standards with just a click. I also love that I can simply give my administrator my Member number and he can easily check my plan book without me 
having to print it out and hand it in! With all of the additional paperwork increasingly heaped upon teachers, it's so nice to come across something that saves time
and work rather than creating more! In addition, I want to thank you for your prompt response to any questions or suggestions I had! I hope what I said was OK.
It was certainly from the heart. I love your planbook!!!! Thanks again for simplifying my life this year!
